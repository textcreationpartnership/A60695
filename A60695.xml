            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Introduction.</head>
                  <p>THERE is nothing gives a greater check to the progre≈øs of an Art, than to believe it is already perfected by tho≈øe that have gone before us, and ≈øo to content our ≈øelves with their determinations: For had our ancient Arti≈øts been thus ≈øupinely credulous, and thought it ≈øufficient to have traced their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors, limiting their wits within other mens bounds, never had time brought to light ≈øuch di≈øcoveries in our Profe≈ø≈øion, nor had the my≈øteries of our Art been ≈øo far communicated to po≈øterity as they already are.</p>
                  <p>This con≈øideration induced me to make an attempt for the cultivating and improving our <hi>Art</hi> to a greater perfection than it had as yet attain'd to: In order to which con≈øidering the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of it, and ob≈øerving that our profe≈ø≈øion has ≈øuch a corre≈øpondence with that of a Phy≈øician, that they differ not at all ≈øaving in the ≈øubject they act upon; I begun to think, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever would excel in the knowledge of the one, mu≈øt arrive at it by the ≈øame method as the others do. Now he that once bends his mind toward the practice of Phy≈øick, fir≈øt applies him≈øelf to the ≈øtudy of Anatomy, to under≈øtand all the Parts (with their actions and u≈øes) of that Body which is to be the ≈øubject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Art is to be exerci≈øed; without which no wi≈øe man will think him capable of that profe≈ø≈øion. And yet how rare among≈øt the greate≈øt part of tho≈øe that think them≈øelves no mean Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, is the knowledge of that Creature they practi≈øe upon? whereas it is plain, ≈øeeing they know not the ≈øituation and u≈øe of the parts, they can make but wide gue≈ø≈øes at the ≈øeat or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the di≈øtemper, and ≈øo mu≈øt admini≈øter their Medicines at random and at all adventures, and be in the mo≈øt opprobrious ≈øen≈øe <hi>Hor≈øe-doctors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay I will be bold to ≈øay ≈øomething more (which I hope I may ≈øpeak without the envy of Phy≈øicians, for whom I have a profound re≈øpect) that in ≈øome regards Anatomy is more nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary
<pb facs="tcp:57416:5"/>to Farriers than to them, in order to find out di≈øea≈øes: For be≈øides the pul≈øe and the urine, and the pathognomonick ≈øigns (as they call them) of each di≈øtemper, they are a≈ø≈øi≈øted in their enquiry moreover (not to ≈øay chiefly) by the complaints and relations of the Patients them≈øelves: whereas a Farrier having to do with a dumb creature, mu≈øt be very curious in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the parts with their offices, and of the ≈øympathy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent that one part hath with another; or el≈øe, ≈øeeing all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation mu≈øt be of his own hammering out, he's like to make but a ≈øhort di≈øcovery of the di≈øtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the parts is to the di≈øcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øea≈øes.</note> Now there are two things chiefly nece≈ø≈øary to the judging or di≈øcerning of a di≈øea≈øe, namely the <hi>Affection</hi> or di≈øtemper, and the <hi>part Affected</hi> or di≈øtempered; the ≈øignes of which are many, but e≈øpecially from the <hi>action</hi> of the part affected: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he that knows the action of the Stomach to be concoction or dige≈øtion, if the concoction be impaired or hindred, he may ea≈øily judge that the Stomach is ill affected. So likewi≈øe he that knows the ≈øituation of the <hi>Liver</hi> to be on the right ≈øide, and the <hi>Spleen</hi> on the left; if the right ≈øide be ≈øore or do ≈øwell, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that the Liver and not the Spleen is affected, and will therefore apply his remedies accordingly. Now he that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the parts of the Body ≈øhall ill know either the ≈øituation or action of either the≈øe parts mentioned or any other: and there is no way to come to the under≈øtanding of them but by Anatomy.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then the profit and nece≈ø≈øity of under≈øtanding Anatomy is ≈øuch and of ≈øo great u≈øe to us, I thought I could not ≈øpend my time and endeavours on any thing more conducing to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our profe≈ø≈øion, than by applying my ≈øelf unto <hi>it</hi> in the fir≈øt place; wherein having none that have gone before me or ≈øhew'd me the way, I hope all ingenuous men will be favourable to my undertaking, and not be over ≈øevere Cen≈øors of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections they may po≈ø≈øibly meet with in the following Treati≈øe; and I hope al≈øo that having broken the Ice, as we ≈øay, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving Arti≈øts will be excited to Emulation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A definition of Anatomy.</note> This Treati≈øe then de≈øigning to teach the Anatomy of an Hor≈øe, we mu≈øt in the fir≈øt place let you know what <hi>Anatomy</hi> is: <q>It is an opening or cutting up of the Body of any Animal or living Creature what≈øoever, whether frequenting the land or water,

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The method of Anatomy.</note> Next we come to ≈øhew after what <hi>manner</hi> you are to take in hand the di≈ø≈øection of any of the≈øe Creatures, and that you mu≈øt not doe confu≈øedly nor di≈øorderly, but with due cour≈øe of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For the doing of which take the≈øe following Rules.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt then, you mu≈øt begin with that which is be≈øt known and mo≈øt ea≈øie, which are the external or outward parts; for as much as the knowledge of them is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, as to Cures Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical: and the≈øe parts are commonly di≈øtingui≈øhed into two kinds; one of which are called <hi>≈øpermatical</hi> and ≈øolid, which are ≈øuppo≈øed to be bred of ≈øeed, and ≈øuch are Bones, Gri≈øtles and Ligaments; and the other <hi>≈øanguineous,</hi> ≈øaid to be generated of bloud, as Mu≈øcles.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall not in this place give you any particular in≈øtructions for the anatomi≈øing any of the≈øe parts, referring you for them to the book it ≈øelf: onely adverti≈øe you of this, that when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire a Body for examining the ≈øolid parts, the bodies of old and lean Hor≈øes are the fitte≈øt, in regard the fle≈øh and fat will not ≈øo much hinder, nor hide the parts from you, as in fat Hor≈øes they will.</p>
                  <p>You are al≈øo to ob≈øerve that there is a two-fold way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in di≈ø≈øection: The one is where there is a plenty, the other where there is a ≈øcarcity of dead bodies. If there be a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then you may look into the Mu≈øcles of one, into the Entrails of another, and into the Ve≈ø≈øels of a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not mattering though you ≈øpoil one part in di≈øcovering another: but where they are ≈øo ≈øcarce that you can get but one body and that ≈øeldome too, then if you would ≈øee all in that body, great skill mu≈øt be u≈øed to ≈øhew every thing in its order and place.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57416:6"/>
                  <p>Now order of di≈ø≈øection requires that you ≈øhould fir≈øt begin with the Head, it being the mo≈øt noble and excellent part; next to that the Che≈øt, and la≈øtly the Belly: but this (as I have ≈øaid) is not to be done where there is but one body, for there you mu≈øt begin with tho≈øe parts that are mo≈øt ≈øubject to Corruption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you mu≈øt fir≈øt cut up the Lower Belly, then the Che≈øt, and la≈øtly the Head; both which ways are often u≈øed; the fir≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the way of dignity, and the other of diuturnity; the one being more noble, and the other of a longer durance.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall not here treat of any of the parts contained in the≈øe three Regions or Venters, but will leave them till I come to ≈øpeak of them in their order in the following Treati≈øe, my de≈øign being to be as brief as may be, and not to repeat any thing over ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, as I have ≈øeen ≈øome Authours have done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ≈øhall put an end to this Introduction when I ≈øhall have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you, that all the parts which fall under the Anatomi≈øts knife to be examined are commonly reduced to two heads, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>≈øimple</hi> or ≈øimilar, and <hi>compound</hi> or di≈ø≈øimilar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. The divi≈øion of the parts, into Simple,</note> Tho≈øe that are generally accounted <hi>≈øimple</hi> parts, are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ten, namely, a Bone, a Gri≈øtle, a Ligament, a Membrane, a Fibre, a Nerve, an Artery, a Vein, Fle≈øh and Skin.

                  <p>Yet three of the≈øe ten, though they are generally accounted ≈øimple parts, if ≈øtrictly taken cannot be truly reputed ≈øo; for fir≈øt, Veins are made of a coat, fibres and valves; ≈øecondly, Arteries are made of two coats or skins different from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and for Nerves, their inner ≈øub≈øtance is medullar or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowey, and the outward, membranous or skinny: ≈øo that of truly ≈øimilar or ≈øimple parts, there are onely ≈øeven, namely, Bones, Gri≈øtles, Ligaments, Membranes, Fibres, Fle≈øh and Skin.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57416:7"/>for example, A Leg may be cut into ≈øeveral pieces, yet not into ≈øeveral Legs, but into Fle≈øh, Bones, Veins and other things which it is compounded of; whereas, as was ≈øaid, a ≈øimilar part though it be divided into parcels, yet tho≈øe are ≈øtill like one another, and of the ≈øame nature: for ≈øuppo≈øe a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be cut into many pieces, every piece partakes onely and truly of the nature of a Ligament, and all remain what they were before, their length or other accident onely excepted.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Introduction,</hi> wherein I mainly intended to ≈øhew the method of Anatomy, and to hint the rea≈øon of my undertaking; It now remains that I addre≈øs my ≈øelf to the Work it ≈øelf, which ≈øhall be writ with the greate≈øt plainne≈øs its nature is capable of, that I may thereby attain to that wi≈øhed end I ≈øet before me, namely, the benefiting of my Reader.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Whereof Hairs are ingendred. How nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed. How the Hair comes to fall off. Rea≈øons for the different colour of the hairs. Their u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BEFORE I take in pieces this Goodly Creature, It will not be ami≈øs if I fir≈øt give you an account of all the≈øe Parts as they lie in order, beginning with that which fir≈øt appeareth to our View, and that is the Scarf-skin adorned with hairs, wherein (as in a Ca≈øe) Nature hath wrapped this ≈øtately Bea≈øt; be≈øides which there are other four, that, with this, are <hi>common</hi> to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which are, fir≈øt, the true skin, which lieth next under it; then the fle≈øhy pannicle; under that the fat; and la≈øtly the common membrane of the Mu≈øcles. Be≈øides the≈øe five, there are other Inve≈øting parts, but they are onely <hi>proper</hi> to particular parts of the body, to which I will ≈øpeak in their due place, and onely of the <hi>common</hi> ones here.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt then I will begin with the <hi>Hairs,</hi> becau≈øe they meet fir≈øt with the Sen≈øe. They are ≈øaid to be ingendred of a clammy and earthy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the third concoction, ≈øo that them≈øelves are reputed not ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be called parts of the body, as Excrements. They are void of ≈øen≈øe and of animal life, yet they have a vegetative life, ≈øuch as Plants have, to which they owe their growth.</p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57416:9"/>
                        <p>The≈øe Hairs are by ≈øome thought to have for their <hi>nouri≈øhment</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable quantity of that juice of which they are generated, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mini≈øtred unto them. Others think that the Hairs being hollow and porous are nouri≈øhed as the Feathers of Fowl are, and that is by bloud; for if one pull off a Feather from a young Bird that is unfledged, a pretty deal of its ≈øtem will appear bloudy. But though we ≈øhould grant that the matter of their nouri≈øhment were made of bloud, yet certainly it mu≈øt be very much altered and degenerate from its own nature, before it can be adapted to the hair, ≈øeeing the hair of a Man's head (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) grows not onely in living per≈øons, who≈øe bloud runs briskly in their Arteries and Veins, whereby it is kept from corruption, but al≈øo in the dead, in whom the whole ma≈øs of bloud is devoid of all nutritive power, as has been often ob≈øerved in bodies pre≈øerved unburied. But what≈øoever the humour be that nouri≈øhes them, it is thru≈øt through the skin by the pores thereof, the action and heat of the body a≈ø≈øi≈øting thereunto, where the purer part of it enters the roots of the hair, but the more earthy not being able to enter ≈øuch almo≈øt unperceivable pores, is driven out among≈øt the hair where it becomes du≈øt; which du≈øt is that that is brought forth with the Curry-combe when a Hor≈øe is dre≈øt. From hence then it is, that a Hor≈øe, though he be never ≈øo well dre≈ø≈øed one morning, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo clean kept till the next, he ≈øhall notwith≈øtanding be as full of du≈øt as he was the morning before; for the cleaner the skin of a Hor≈øe is kept, the more open are its pores to tran≈ømit a more plentifull nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the hair, whence al≈øo there is a greater collection of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious du≈øt.</p>
                        <p>And hence may be gathered a rea≈øon of the <hi>≈øhedding</hi> of the hair, which is ob≈øerved to happen in many Hor≈øes that have ill keeping, ≈øuch as your Cart-hor≈øes that ≈øeldom have any labour be≈øtowed upon them, for want of which dre≈ø≈øing, to remove the du≈øt which lieth upon the mouths of the pores or at the roots of the hairs, the pa≈ø≈øages, through which the juice ≈øhould come that nouri≈øhes the hair, are ob≈øtructed or ≈øtopped, and ≈øo like dead Leaves from a Tree in Autumn they drop off, or as untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fruit falls before the ≈øea≈øon of the year requireth it.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Colours</hi> of the hairs, they are various, according as is the humour which doth predominate in the body: for ≈øuch as the humour is which is driven forth towards the skin for their nouri≈øhment, ≈øuch will the colour of the hair be. As for In≈øtance:</p>
                        <p>If the cholerick humour doth mo≈øt predominate, then are the hairs of a black, a Sorrel or a Che≈øtnut colour; If bloud mo≈øt predominate, then will the Hor≈øe be a bright Bay or Roan; If flegme, then the Hor≈øe will be of a milk-white or yellow-dun; If melancholy, then will the Hor≈øe be of an Iron-gray or Mou≈øe-dun. Thus much for the colour of the hairs, next I come to the u≈øe of them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the hairs is, fir≈øt, to cover the skin; ≈øecondly, to defend it; thirdly, to be an ornament to it; and la≈øtly, as I have before ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ≈øuck up that excrementitious ≈øuperfluous juice which through the pores of the skin is ≈øent from all parts of the body to them.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Cuticle or Scarf-skin.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Scarf-skin. Its u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Hide on which the hairs already ≈øpoken of do grow, con≈øi≈øts of two Skins, the outer of which is called the <hi>Scarf-skin,</hi> ≈øerving to defend the Body from outward Injuries, and for that intent is of it ≈øelf In≈øen≈øible, that it may the better indure the violence of the weather, or other harms which many times happen to it. And for that cau≈øe, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ≈øo ordered it, that if at any time it happeneth to be rubb'd off, as often it is by an ill Saddle, and many other ways, it groweth again without a ≈øcar or blemi≈øh, provided the Parts under it (as particularly the true Skin) be not al≈øo violated; for they being ≈øpermatical Parts, or made of Seed, cannot ea≈øily be re≈øtored, which is the rea≈øon that mo≈øt Wounds will not heal up without a ≈øcar. Now this Scarf-skin having its matter (of which it is made) from the true Skin and the Ve≈ø≈øels that terminate in it, which are of all ≈øorts, both Veins, Arteries and Nerves, none of which reach any farther than the true Skin, it is apparent that this Skin is without ≈øen≈øe, it being their office alone to communicate both life, ≈øen≈øe and motion to all parts of the Body. And that this Skin is void of ≈øen≈øe, may be ≈øeen by the cutting of it; as thus, If you cut onely through this Skin, when you go to Rowel a Hor≈øe, you ≈øhall not find the Hor≈øe move for it, neither will it bleed; but if you cut ≈øo far as to touch the true Skin under it, you will find him both ≈øtir and bleed, for then you touch the little threads of the Ve≈ø≈øels, and by violating them, you cau≈øe the Hor≈øe to feel pain, and al≈øo bloud to i≈ø≈øue forth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Skin, be≈øides being a covering to the whole Body, is to cover the mouths of tho≈øe ≈ømall hairy Ve≈ø≈øels already ≈øpoken of, that the bloud, ≈øpirits, or other ichorous or watery Matter do not i≈ø≈øue from them, which otherwi≈øe they would. Yet its Pores are ≈øo large as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the vapourous moi≈øture that is thru≈øt out of all parts of the Body to it, to pa≈øs through them, either in the form of ≈øweat, or by in≈øen≈øible tran≈øpiration. The≈øe Pores being many times ob≈øtructed or con≈øtringed by a ≈øudden cold taken after hard riding, by giving the Hor≈øe cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too ≈øoon after it, or by wa≈øhing him too high in cold Water when he is hot, the Vapours are thereby hindered from coming forth, and ≈øo are detained between the two Skins, and there generate evill Di≈øtempers, or at lea≈øt fall from thence into the Limbs, and there cau≈øe Inflammations and breakings out, which we call <hi>Grea≈øe in the heels</hi> or <hi>Scratchets.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>UNder this Scarf, lieth the <hi>true Skin,</hi> which the Latines call <hi>Cutis.</hi> Its <hi>≈øub≈øtance,</hi> as I have before ≈øhewed, is ≈øaid to be ≈øpermatical, ≈øuch as being once lo≈øt, cannot be re≈øtored as formerly it was, but is reunited by a cicatrice or ≈øcar, that is bred of the dried and con≈øtringed fle≈øh under it; which is the rea≈øon no hairs will grow upon that part of the Skin where the ≈øcar is, becau≈øe it is callous and de≈øtitute of Pores in which they ≈øhould grow. This Skin doth encompa≈øs the whole Body as well as the Scarf, and hath the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øages for the receiving in, and letting out, for the ea≈øe and relief of the Body, as that hath.</p>
                        <p>It hath for its nouri≈øhment, life, and ≈øen≈øe, <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of all ≈øorts, Veins, Arteries and Nerves, divaricated and branched through it in the ≈ømalle≈øt hair-like threads, all which terminate in it, none of them being in≈øerted into the Cuticle.</p>
                        <p>As for its <hi>colour,</hi> it varieth as do the humours in the Body; for that humour which mo≈øt abounds, coloureth it with its proper re≈øpective co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; as for example, If bloud mo≈øt abound, then is it mo≈øt red; if choler do mo≈øt predominate, then is it yellowi≈øh; and ≈øo for the other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is principally to inve≈øt and defend the Body, as I have ≈øaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Scarf-skin: for as that keeps it from the violent impre≈ø≈øion of either exce≈ø≈øive heat, or cold; ≈øo doth this Skin re≈øtrain, and, as it were, wall in (as in a Ca≈øtle) all the ≈øpirits and natural heat, which would otherwi≈øe in hot weather, or in violent exerci≈øe be ≈øo fa≈øt ≈øpent, that they would leave the vital parts de≈øtitute, which would occa≈øion the lo≈øs of your Bea≈øt. But though Nature has made this provi≈øion to hinder the di≈ø≈øipation of the ≈øpirits, yet has ≈øhe framed the Skin (as well as the Scarf-skin) full of ≈ømall Pores, through which upon violent exerci≈øe do i≈ø≈øue in great plenty hot and moi≈øt vapours, which are that we call <hi>≈øweat;</hi> yea though the Bea≈øt be at re≈øt, if the Air be any whit mild or temperate, warm ≈øteams are continually a pa≈ø≈øing through them by in≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible tran≈øpiration.</p>
                        <p>It's al≈øo as ≈øerviceable in cold weather, for then the more fiercely it is be≈øieged by the cold, the narrower do the afore≈øaid Pores pur≈øe up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, whereby the internal heat is detained within, and the external cold kept out.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the fle≈øhy Pannicle.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The names of the fle≈øhy Pannicle. Its ≈øituation, and extent. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>NEXT to the true Skin, lieth the fle≈øhy Pannicle, called <hi>membrana Carno≈øa,</hi> or <hi>panniculus carno≈øus,</hi> becau≈øe in mo≈øt parts of the Body, it comes near to the nature of fle≈øh, and is truly mu≈øcular.</p>
                        <p>In Man this Membrane is ≈øaid to lie under the Fat, though ≈øome very curious Anatomi≈øts deny that Man has any ≈øuch Membrane at all, ≈øave in the Forehead; and of this opinion is Dr. <hi>Gli≈ø≈øon.</hi> I will not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in that Controver≈øie, as being not proper for me; but in Hor≈øes it lies immediately under the Skin, above the Fat, and is more like to a Mu≈øcle than a Membrane. In fleying off the Skin, you mu≈øt be very carefull and curious, or el≈øe you will take this Pannicle off along with it, it is ≈øo clo≈øely knit to it by Fibres and innumerable Ve≈ø≈øels that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. It is of the ≈øame extent and figure as the true Skin, inve≈øting the whole Body as that does; but in ≈øome Parts it is almo≈øt wholly fle≈øhy, and in others altogether membranous.</p>
                        <p>It has <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of all ≈øorts as the Skin has, for before they can reach the Skin, they mu≈øt pierce through this Membrane; and as they pa≈øs through, they ≈øend forth many ≈ømall twigs into it, both Veins, Arteries and Nerves, but e≈øpecially Nerves to a≈ø≈øi≈øt its motion, whence it is by ≈øome called the nervous Membrane.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of it is chiefly to ≈øerve for a Mu≈øcle to move the Skin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Bea≈øt ≈øhakes off the Flies, or any other thing that offends him. It ≈øerves al≈øo to defend the neighbouring Parts, and to ≈øtrengthen in their pa≈ø≈øage the Ve≈ø≈øels which are di≈ø≈øeminated into the true Skin. It al≈øo hinders the Fat from being melted and ≈øpent by the continual motion of the Mu≈øcles. And la≈øtly, it helpeth to heal or clo≈øe up the Skin when it is cut or otherwi≈øe hurt; for the Skin being a ≈øpermatick Part cannot be bred anew, and therefore this fle≈øhy Membrane helps to glew as it were the ≈øides of it together again, growing into one body with it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what we call a <hi>Scar.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Fat, and Common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Fat, its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and matter. How genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The u≈øes of Fat. The common membrane of the Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FAT</hi> is of two ≈øorts, and is di≈øtingui≈øhed by two ≈øeveral Names as well in Latin as Engli≈øh. That which we are to ≈øpeak of in this Chapter is called in Latin <hi>pinguedo,</hi> and in Engli≈øh <hi>Fat;</hi> but that which is within the Belly and makes up the Caul and Me≈øentery and covers the Kidneys, is named <hi>≈øevum,</hi> Suet or <hi>Tallow.</hi> The former will not congeal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57416:11"/>≈øo quickly or ≈øo hard as this latter will. Both the one and the other are made of an oily part of the bloud; and this we are to treat of here, is congealed between the Carnous Membrane de≈øcribed in the foregoing Chapter, and the Common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>This Fat is the fourth common covering of the whole Body, for there is no Part which has the re≈øt of the common coverings, but has this al≈øo, if the Hor≈øe be not extreme lean; though the fatte≈øt have it not in any great plenty. Now as all Food that is eaten, con≈øi≈øts of ≈øeveral parts or principles, which the Chymi≈øts can ≈øeparate one from another, namely Salt, Spirit and Oyl; ≈øo the Food, that con≈øi≈øts of the≈øe ≈øeveral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when it is taken into the Body, and concocted in the Stomach (which is natural Chymi≈øtry, as I may call it) has them ≈øo loo≈øened one from another, that each principle pa≈ø≈øes into the nouri≈øhment and increa≈øe of that part that is of the ≈øame nature with it. Among≈øt the re≈øt the oily part, (which is otherwi≈øe called the Sulphureous, becau≈øe it will flame like Brim≈øtone) ≈øweating as it were through the pores of the Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels and ≈øubjacent parts towards the ≈øurface of the Body, is ≈øtopt by the clo≈øene≈øs and compactne≈øs of the fle≈øhy Membrane, and there congeals into Fat. Now this Fat is not one continued body as Butter or (what we call) tryed Suet is; but is included in innumerable membranous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or cells, almo≈øt like Honey-combs, (which it is likely are borrowed from the fle≈øhy Pannicle) which makes the Fat to appear ≈øomewhat ≈øpongy. It is not ea≈øie to give a rea≈øon of this oily humour's turning into Fat; for it cannot be by cold, ≈øeeing the Bea≈øt is always actually warm; much le≈øs can it be by heat, which is apter to melt Fat into Oyl, than to harden Oyl into Fat: therefore ≈øome make a moderate heat to be the efficient of it. 'Tis true indeed that the Bea≈øt is moderately hot, and we ≈øee by experience that Fat is generated; but that <hi>that</hi> is the cau≈øe of <hi>this,</hi> I dare not affirm. My apprehen≈øion of it is this: That when the oily Matter i≈ø≈øues out of the Veins and Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there pa≈ø≈øes along with it much thin watry humour; And when they both come to the fle≈øhy Membrane, this latter being thin, evaporates through it and is evacuated by ≈øweat or in≈øen≈øible tran≈øpiration; but the other being thicker and more clammy, is forced to ≈øtay behind, and lo≈øing by degrees that wheyi≈øh humour that before kept it liquid, it curdles into Fat.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the Fat is, like a Garment, to keep the Body warm, and cheri≈øh the natural heat, which by its clammine≈øs it hinders from evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating too much; and on the other ≈øide by its thickne≈øs it ≈øtoppeth the Pores ≈øo, that the cold cannot enter in.</p>
                        <p>It al≈øo fills up the empty ≈øpaces between the Mu≈øcles, and the wrinkles of the Skin, by which the Hor≈øe is made plump, ≈ømooth and beautifull; and therefore old, lean and decrepit Hor≈øes are deformed for want of Fat.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øerves al≈øo as a pillow or bulwark again≈øt any violence, either from blows, brui≈øes or heavy weights, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it relieveth ≈øuch Creatures as abound with it, in time of ≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or want of ≈øu≈øtenance, by being converted into nouri≈øhment; for it ≈øerves as aliment, and holdeth the parts of the Body in play, till the Creature attain its proper Food.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and la≈øt common Covering of the Body, is the <hi>Common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles.</hi> This is ≈øpread over all the Mu≈øcles (imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under the Fat) and is knit by Fibres to that Membrane which is proper to each Mu≈øcle, but ≈øomewhat loo≈øely, that it might not hinder
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57416:11"/>their motion by inve≈øting them too clo≈øely. It is ≈øaid to ari≈øe from the Back-bone, becau≈øe it cleaves mo≈øt firmly to the Spine thereof, and is ≈øtronger there, than in its other Parts. In an Hor≈øe it is as thick as Parchment, and very ≈øtrong. And its u≈øe is to confirm and ≈øtrengthen the Mu≈øcles in general in their proper ≈øituation, and to be as it were a Ca≈øe for them to move glibly in, and to defend them from injuries.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING ≈øhewed you what are the <hi>common inve≈øting</hi> or containing parts of the whole Body, I come now to ≈øhew which are tho≈øe that are <hi>proper</hi> to the Lower Belly in particular, and tho≈øe are onely two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides tho≈øe common ones already ≈øpoken of, namely the <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> of the Paunch, and the <hi>Rim of the Belly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now by the <hi>Lower Belly</hi> we under≈øtand all that cavity (and onely that) which is below the Midriff, and is encompa≈ø≈øed by the ≈øhort Ribs, the point of the Brea≈øt-bone, Loins, Haunch-bones, and Share-bones, and is filled with the Guts and other Entrails.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> are in all Hor≈øes of a like number,which is on each ≈øide four. The fir≈øt pair that ≈øhew them≈øelves are called the <hi>External oblique</hi> pair; the next are the <hi>Internal oblique</hi> pair; the third are the two <hi>right</hi> or <hi>≈øtreight</hi> Mu≈øcles; and under the≈øe are the two <hi>tran≈øver≈øe</hi> Mu≈øcles, ≈øo called from their going cro≈øs the Belly.</p>
                        <p>But before I proceed any further in de≈øcribing the≈øe Mu≈øcles, I will fir≈øt ≈øhew what a <hi>Mu≈øcle</hi> is, and whereof it is compounded, and al≈øo the ≈øeveral u≈øes of the Mu≈øcles in general.</p>
                        <p>The Mu≈øcles, if you take them in a large ≈øignification, are all that which we call Fle≈øh; which Fle≈øh may be divided into many pieces or parcels without cutting or breaking any of them, if with care undertaken; and each piece ≈øo ≈øeparable, is named a Mu≈øcle.</p>
                        <p>Now the≈øe pieces have each their ≈øeveral di≈øtinct Epithets, appellations or names from ≈øeveral con≈øiderations, as from their ≈øituation, ≈øhape, u≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but are all called Mu≈øcles, their office being to perform the <hi>voluntary motion:</hi> which motion is performed ≈øix ≈øeveral ways, namely, upwards, downwards, forwards, backwards, to the right hand and to the left. All which motions are performed in this manner.</p>
                        <p>You mu≈øt know that all or mo≈øt of the Mu≈øcles of the Body have each their Oppo≈øite or Antagoni≈øt, ≈øo that the one being contracted or drawn together, (which is its proper motion) the oppo≈øite at the ≈øame time is relaxed or loo≈øned; and contrarily when that which upon the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was relaxed, does it ≈øelf enter upon motion, it is contracted, whil≈øt that which was before contracted, is now relaxed. As for example, when you ≈øtretch out either your Arm, or Leg, that motion is performed by one of the≈øe Mu≈øcles; and when you draw your Arm, or Leg back again, that is performed by the other.</p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57416:12"/>
                        <p>But here let none ≈øo far mi≈øunder≈øtand me as to think that either an Arm or Leg can be either ≈øtretcht forth or drawn back by the help of <hi>one</hi> Mu≈øcle alone; but <hi>as</hi> to either of the before mentioned Limbs there are ≈øeveral parts belonging, <hi>≈øo</hi> do the di≈øtinct Mu≈øcles of every part perform (at the ≈øame time) the offices afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <p>Neither can this voluntary motion be performed without the help of a Sinew or Nerve, by which the Spirits are brought from the Brain which give the Mu≈øcles their moving faculty.</p>
                        <p>Now there are other motions of the Body which are not performed by the Mu≈øcles, ≈øuch as is (according to ≈øome) the pul≈øation of the Heart and Arteries, the peri≈øtaltick motion of the Stomach and Guts, of the pa≈ø≈øage of the Gall, and of the Ureters, and ≈øeveral other Parts which have their continual motions whether the Hor≈øe be ≈øleeping or waking, and will perform their ≈øeveral motions as well in Men as Bea≈øts, whether we will or not. Wherefore the≈øe are called <hi>not Voluntary,</hi> or <hi>Natural.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall in the next place ≈øhew what parts the Mu≈øcles are compounded of, and tho≈øe are agreed upon by all Authours of Anatomy to be the≈øe.</p>
                        <p>A Mu≈øcle being an organical Part is compo≈øed of Nerves, Fle≈øh, Fibres, Veins and Arteries, all covered or inve≈øted with a proper Coat or Skin. It is called <hi>organical,</hi> becau≈øe it is the in≈øtrument or organ of an action, to wit, motion. And that it is al≈øo di≈ø≈øimilar, the ≈øeveral kinds of parts whereof it is made, do evidently prove. The ≈øeveral u≈øes of the parts that make up a Mu≈øcle are the≈øe: The Fibres and Tendon are the immediate in≈øtruments of its action; The Fle≈øh properly ≈øo called filleth up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter≈øtices or di≈øtances between the Fibres; The Arteries by importing vital ≈øpirit and bloud do con≈øerve the inbred heat, and help to nouri≈øh it; The Veins do convey back to the Heart all that bloud that remains from the nouri≈øhment of the Mu≈øcle; The Nerves convey animal Spirit to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres and Tendon, whereby they are enabled for their action; and the Membrane or Skin which incompa≈ø≈øeth the Mu≈øcle, doth keep it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and di≈øtingui≈øhes one from another.</p>
                        <p>Having ≈øhewed what a Mu≈øcle is, and the ≈øeveral ≈øimple parts whereof it is made, I ≈øhall next ≈øhew you why it is ≈øo called. It is called <hi>mus,</hi> or <hi>mu≈øculus,</hi> by the Latins, for that it is like a fley'd Mou≈øe, or a Fi≈øh which is called <hi>mu≈øculus;</hi> and by ≈øome Authours it is called by the name of <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certus,</hi> from its ≈øimilitude with a Creature called a Lizard. Yet there can be no one certain figure whereby to re≈øemble it, by rea≈øon of its ≈øundry ≈øhapes; but that it is like a fley'd Mou≈øe in colour, cannot be denied.</p>
                        <p>Now the Mu≈øcles being many in number have accordingly many names, which names they take from either their Figure, their Situation, or their Action, and many times from their U≈øe; al≈øo ≈øometimes from their In≈øertion, and ≈øometimes from their Magnitude.</p>
                        <p>And although there be ≈øuch difference in the Mu≈øcles, in re≈øpect of their Figures, their Magnitude, their Situation, and the like, yet are they ≈øo united or conjoyned together through the whole Body, in ≈øo clo≈øe a manner, that in many places they are hard to be ≈øeparated, except at ≈øome times, when either wind, ≈øome wheyi≈øh humour or ≈øome other matter gets between them, and then many times they will gape, and are at ≈øome di≈øtance the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>Yet are they not ≈øo clo≈øely united neither, but that by a carefull and expert Di≈ø≈øector they may be ≈øeparated, and one divided from another;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57416:12"/>after which, to ≈øee the ≈øeveral parts of a Mu≈øcle ≈øeverally, you mu≈øt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it al≈øo, which is on this manner.</p>
                        <p>Some divide a Mu≈øcle into two parts, which are a fle≈øhy and a tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous part; Again, they divide it into other three parts, namely, the Head, the Middle and the Tail. By the <hi>Head</hi> is to be under≈øtood the beginning or original of a Mu≈øcle, which is one while ligamentous and nervous, and otherwhiles fle≈øhy: By the <hi>Middle</hi> is that part meant which is ab≈øolutely fle≈øhy; and by the <hi>Tail,</hi> the Tendon, con≈øi≈øting of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Fibres that are extended through the Mu≈øcle, and the Membrane that inve≈øts it, which grow by little and little into one body, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe this Tendon, that is the tail of the Mu≈øcle. It is ≈øometimes round, ≈øometimes broad; other times long, and otherwhiles ≈øhort, thicker or ≈ølenderer according to the part it appertains to, or according to the u≈øe it is put to; it being but nece≈ø≈øary that tho≈øe Parts which are moved mo≈øt ≈øtrongly or vehemently, ≈øhould have thicker and ≈øtronger Tendons. Thus much for the Mu≈øcles in general.</p>
                        <p>Now I come to the particular Mu≈øcles, the fir≈øt of which are the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Paunch, of which I have ≈øpoken ≈øomething in the beginning of this Chapter, the which I ≈øhall now further pro≈øecute, and let you know how they are ≈øituated. The pair that in di≈ø≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fir≈øt offer them≈øelves are called the <hi>Oblique</hi> (or ≈ølanting) <hi>De≈øcending External</hi> pair, which pair are the broade≈øt of all the re≈øt,though it is by many Authours ≈øaid that the oblique internal are equal in figure, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ≈øtrength and action. The original or ri≈øe of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is from the ≈øide of the Brea≈øt-bone, the lower edge of five or ≈øix of the lowe≈øt Ribs, and from the tips of the cro≈øs or tran≈øver≈øe proce≈ø≈øes of the Joints of the Rack-bone in the Loins. Their ri≈øe from the Ribs imitates the teeth of a Saw; for ≈øpringing with a narrow point from the lower ≈øide of the Rib, every ≈øuch point grows broader and broader, till it unite with the two next it on each ≈øide, ≈øo that there is a ≈øpace of above an inch between every point, into which empty ≈øpaces the greater Saw-like Mu≈øcle of the Brea≈øt ends with like points. From their ri≈øe they run ≈øloping downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>white line</hi> (≈øo called) in the middle of the Belly; but before they reach half way thither, they lo≈øe their fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance, and become tendinous, and their Tendon is ≈øo united to the common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles, de≈øcribed in the foregoing Chapter, that it ≈øeems to become one with it, and running over the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles is in≈øerted into the fore≈øaid white Line, down even to the very Share-bone, into which al≈øo it is in≈øerted.</p>
                        <p>The next to the≈øe are the <hi>Oblique A≈øcending Internal</hi> pair, ≈øo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the contrary cour≈øe of their Fibres to tho≈øe of the External; for as tho≈øe <hi>de≈øcend</hi> obliquely or a≈ølant, ≈øo do the≈øe <hi>a≈øcend</hi> in like manner. Their ri≈øe is from the Rib of the Haunch-bone, and from the proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loins and <hi>os ≈øacrum;</hi> and their Tendon is extended to the ≈øhort Ribs partly, and partly to the white line, above the Navel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles as was ≈øaid before of the oblique de≈øcending, where it is not cover'd by the Tendon of that Mu≈øcle. The≈øe have a different <hi>action</hi> from the former; for whereas the External pair do draw the lower part of the Belly towards the Brea≈øt, where they have their original; the≈øe on the contrary draw down the Che≈øt with a kind of ≈ølanting motion towards the Hips; it being the action of all Mu≈øcles to draw towards their original, and the original of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is (as was ≈øaid) at the Rib of the Haunch-bone.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57416:13"/>
                        <p>After the≈øe follow the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Streight</hi> Pair, ≈øo called becau≈øe their Fibres run ≈øtreight down the Belly as do the Mu≈øcles them≈øelves: for their original is at the ≈øides of the ≈øword fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle at the end of the Brea≈øt-bone, and from the gri≈øtly ends of the ba≈øtard Ribs, whence they go all along the eminente≈øt part of the Belly ≈øtreight to the Share-bone where they terminate. Now in the≈øe Mu≈øcles there are ≈øeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcriptions or tendinous Inter≈øtices, which are, according to the bigne≈øs of the Hor≈øe, more or fewer in number, but mo≈øt commonly there are in each Mu≈øcle eight, not ≈øo fair indeed as in Humane Bodies, but yet ≈øo plain, that they do di≈øtingui≈øh the Mu≈øcles into nine parts or more, as there are eight of the≈øe in≈øcriptions or more; and be≈øides, each part has a di≈øtinct Nerve: and yet notwith≈øtanding, becau≈øe they cannot be ea≈øily ≈øeparated one from another, they do by mo≈øt Anatomi≈øts go for onely one pair. On the in≈øide of the≈øe Mu≈øcles are to be ≈øeen the Epiga≈øtrick Arteries and Veins a≈øcending, and the Mammary Arteries and Veins de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, which by an ancient Tradition have been held in Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ino≈øculate one with another, the Arteries with the Arteries, and the Veins with the Veins; but later and more inqui≈øitively curious Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi≈øts have di≈øcovered it to be a mere fancy, invented to ≈øupport the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Opinion, That whil≈øt the Young was in the Womb, it was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed with bloud carried to it by the Hypoga≈øtrick Arteries and Veins; but after the birth, the bloud altering its cour≈øe, regurgitated up from the Womb, by the Epiga≈øtrick Ve≈ø≈øels, which ino≈øculating with the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, conveyed it to the Brea≈øts, where it was converted into Milk. This I ≈øay was the opinion as to Women, which has in ≈øeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars been detected of errour: and may receive a further confutation in Mares, from the different ≈øituation of their Udders from the Brea≈øts in Women; whereas the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels have the ≈øame Cour≈øe in both. The <hi>action</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is to ≈øhorten the Belly by drawing the Brea≈øt and Share-bone towards one another, whereby it is drawn as it were on a heap, to ≈øqueez forth the Excrements or Urine, whence Dogs that ≈øtrain ≈øo hard to dung, have the≈øe Mu≈øcles ari≈øing as high up as the Channel-bones.</p>
                        <p>There are other two Mu≈øcles (≈øometimes to be found) which do re≈øt upon the Tendons of the Right Mu≈øcles at the lower end of them, which I have not yet ≈øpoken of, and the≈øe are called the <hi>pyramidal</hi> Mu≈øcles. They are of a triangular figure, and their u≈øe is to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles in their ≈øqueezing forth the Excrements, ≈øaith <hi>Fallopius.</hi> I believe the≈øe Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ≈øo ≈øeldom found, that they ought to be accounted <hi>lu≈øus Naturoe,</hi> a ≈øport of Nature; for I do not remember that ever I have ob≈øerved any other here, but what ought to be accounted the lowe≈øt part or portion of the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles before de≈øcribed.</p>
                        <p>Under all the≈øe lie the tran≈øver≈øe or overthwart Mu≈øcles, ≈øo called from their own and their Fibres running cro≈øs or overthwart the Belly. They are of a quadrangular or four≈øquare figure, and do ≈øtick ≈øo clo≈øe to the Rim of the Belly (which is under them) that they cannot ea≈øily be ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                        <p>Their Original is from the one or two lowe≈øt ba≈øtard Ribs, the tran≈øver≈øe proce≈ø≈øes of the Joints or <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and the Haunch-bones; and their Tendons reach to the white line, where they terminate.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>Action</hi> is to pre≈øs the Guts for the expul≈øion of Excrements.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57416:14"/>
                        <p> Now as each Mu≈øcle has a peculiar action to it ≈øelf, which is that already a≈øcribed to each, ≈øo have all the≈øe ten Mu≈øcles two Actions gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to them all conjoinedly, which are the≈øe; The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is, that they ≈øerve for a defence or bulwark for all the Parts underneath them, and do by their fle≈øh (which pretty much aboundeth in them) cheri≈øh their natural heat and a≈ø≈øi≈øt concoction; The <hi>next</hi> is, that they do all a≈ø≈øi≈øt together in the compre≈ø≈øing of the Guts for the voiding of the excrements, the Midriff a≈ø≈øi≈øting thereunto, by who≈øe help the excrements are thru≈øt downwards, which otherwi≈øe would be onely ≈øqueezed together, and not thru≈øt any more downward than upward.</p>
                        <p>I think it not ami≈øs in this place to explain what it is I call the <hi>white Line,</hi> for fear the naming of it ≈øo often as I have done in this Chapter, without ≈øhewing what it is, ≈øhould puzzle the Reader.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>white Line</hi> is nothing el≈øe, but the extremities or tendinous end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the≈øe Mu≈øcles of the Paunch, and is called <hi>white</hi> from its colour, becoming ≈øo, becau≈øe it con≈øi≈øts of Tendons and Fibres onely, wherewith no fle≈øhy part or particle is interwoven, whereby to change or alter the colour. It di≈øtingui≈øheth the Belly into two parts, a right and a le≈øt, and is placed all along the middle of the Belly both below and above the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, running from the ≈øword-pointed Gri≈øtle of the Brea≈øt as low as to the Share-bone.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>dder</hi> being an external part of the Belly in Mares, I might in this place (in order) treat of it; but becau≈øe its Action, to wit the making of Milk, has ≈øo near relation to the Foal, for which it provides nouri≈øhment, I ≈øhall omit it in this place, and de≈øcribe it at the latter end of this <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Book, after I have done with the generative parts of Mares, and the breeding, nouri≈øhing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Young in the Womb.</p>

                           <p>What the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titonaeum is. Its original. Its perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The outmo≈øt Skins of all the parts of the Lower Belly, have their original from this. Its Compo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Its <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øes.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Mu≈øcles of the Paunch being all removed, as al≈øo their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons which make the white Line before ≈øpoken of, the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly comes next into ≈øight.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is of a ≈øpermatick ≈øub≈øtance (as are all other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes or Skins) and is of an oval Figure, or like a long fa≈øhioned Egg, for it compa≈ø≈øeth all the Lower Belly and ingirts all the Parts therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and al≈øo ≈øtrengthneth them, from whence it hath its name, from its office of <hi>≈øpreading</hi> and <hi>≈øtretching about.</hi> It is thin and ≈øoft, that it might not be either heavy or burthen≈øom; yet is it very ≈øtrong and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, that it might be ≈øtretched without danger, when the Belly is full of Meat, or the Womb is full of the Burthen. Its in≈øide is ≈ømooth, and by rea≈øon of the Guts is daubed with moi≈øture; but its out≈øide is rough, which makes it ≈øtick ≈øo clo≈øe to the Mu≈øcles that lie above it, that they can hardly be ≈øeparated, as I have before ≈øhewed.</p>
                        <p>It takes its <hi>original</hi> from the <hi>vertebrae</hi> or joints of the Loins, where it is very thick, and is therefore believed to proceed from the Membrane that inve≈øts the Marrow in the Back-bone, and is propagated from the double Membrane of the Brain. It is in all places double, and betwixt its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes I have always ob≈øerved good ≈øtore of Fat, which Anatomi≈øts do not ≈øpeak of in other Creatures. The Ve≈ø≈øels run along this Fat between the Membranes, that they may be the better ≈øecured and defended, and may with more ≈øafety di≈øper≈øe their branches all over it; and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it is <hi>perforated</hi> in ≈øeveral places, ≈øo wide as is proportionably nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to the largene≈øs of the Ve≈ø≈øels that are to go through, and no larger, le≈øt in di≈øtentions or ≈øtrains they ≈øhould tear, as too apt they are to do, as Experience daily te≈øtifies in Men and Children, when vehement coughs or long and ≈øtraining cries do, in ≈øome, open the orifice of the Navel, and in others the orifices in the Groin, where the ≈øpermatick or ≈øeminary Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels go forth to the Stones, ≈øo that the widene≈øs gives liberty for the ≈ømall Guts to fall out of their places into the outward parts, which cau≈øeth Ruptures and broken Bellies. The like I have ≈øeen in Hor≈øes.</p>
                        <p>From the inner Membrane of this Rim of the Belly, all the outmo≈øt Skins or Coats which cover every Part contained in the Lower Belly do proceed, and from it have their original, ≈øome thicker and ≈øome thinner, according to the nece≈ø≈øity or u≈øe of the Part re≈øpectively. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Common Membrane of the Kidneys, the proper one of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Spleen (each of which have but one) are but very thin, for ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are never (naturally) extended, there was no nece≈ø≈øity for their being otherwi≈øe; but the Common Skin of the Stomach, the Guts, the Bladder and the Womb are ≈øomewhat thicker, but much ≈øtronger and more compact, becau≈øe the u≈øes they are put to require it, that they may without danger be ≈øtretched, when there is occa≈øion. Now as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails are many and of divers kinds, and al≈øo ≈øituated in ≈øeveral places different from one another, ≈øo does their outward Inve≈øting Membrane
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57416:15"/>take its original from that part of this <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly which is next to them; as the upper Entrails, which are the Stomach, the Liver, the Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> borrow it from that part of the Rim which makes the under Membrane of the Midriff; ≈øo do the lower Entrails (as the Bladder, Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) borrow it from that part of the Rim, which cleaveth to the Share-bone, it being the neare≈øt to them.</p>
                        <p>From this <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly do al≈øo proceed two double Membranes or Skins, which are tho≈øe of the Caul and of the Me≈øentery; as al≈øo ≈øeveral Ligaments, of which the mo≈øt remarkable are tho≈øe of the Liver and Guts.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is compo≈øed of membranous and nervous Fibres which are very ≈ømall. The Ve≈ø≈øels that are di≈øper≈øed through it are ≈ømall branches of Veins and Arteries which it hath from the Midriff, and other neighbouring Parts, as the Seminary and Mammary; and for Nerves, it hath them from the branches which are carried to the Mu≈øcles of the Lower Belly.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øes</hi> are ≈øeveral, the fir≈øt of which is, to cover and contain all the Parts or Entrails of the Lower Belly; ≈øecondly, to further the expul≈øion of the Excrements by pre≈ø≈øing the Stomach and Guts before and on the ≈øides, as the Midriff doth above. Again, it binds with its Ligaments all the Guts in their proper places by mediation of the Me≈øentery, that no violent motion (≈øuch as running or leaping) ≈øhould move them out: By Ligaments proceeding from it, is the Liver al≈øo ≈øu≈øpended in its place. Its la≈øt u≈øe is to be a ≈øafeguard to the Ve≈ø≈øels that run through it, which being but ≈ømall and having a long cour≈øe to run, would be in danger of breaking, were they not ≈øecured between its two Skins.</p>

                        <p>HAVING according to the order of di≈ø≈øection, removed all the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øting</hi> or <hi>containing</hi> Parts of the Lower Belly, and ≈øhewed which, and what they are; it now follows that I ≈øhew which are the parts <hi>inve≈øted</hi> or <hi>contained.</hi> And becau≈øe the <hi>Caul</hi> appears fir≈øt in di≈ø≈øection, I will fir≈øt treat of it.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Caul</hi> is in Latin called <hi>Omentum,</hi> from <hi>Omen,</hi> becau≈øe the Roman Sooth≈øayers pretended by it to foretell things. It is al≈øo called <hi>mappa ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris,</hi> the Map or Di≈øh-clout of the Belly, becau≈øe it ≈øeemeth to lick up the ≈øuperfluities thereof. It doth cover all or mo≈øt of the Guts in many Creatures; but in a Hor≈øe it is mo≈øt times removed from all the lower parts of the Belly, and lieth in wrinkles or folds near and about the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The rea≈øon of its being removed, I do ≈øuppo≈øe, is the hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and violent Exerci≈øe a Hor≈øe undergoeth; for whil≈øt he is young, and before he comes to his labour, it is ≈øpread as far over his Entrails as in other Creatures, as hath been ob≈øerved by the Learned <hi>Marcus Aurelius Severinus,</hi> who did in a She foal which he di≈ø≈øected at <hi>Naples,</hi> ≈øee the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57416:16"/>Caul ≈øpread all over the Guts as far as to the bottom of the Womb, to which it was al≈øo joined with a ≈øtrait connection.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øometimes happeneth that the Caul falleth between the bottom of the Bladder and the neck of the Womb in Women, and then it ≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øeth the mouth of the Womb, that it leaveth very little or no pa≈ø≈øage for the Man's ≈øeed to enter in, which when it ≈øo happeneth is a cau≈øe of barrenne≈øs. But I believe no ≈øuch thing can happen in Mares.</p>
                        <p>It is compo≈øed of two Membranes, the uppermo≈øt or formo≈øt of which ari≈øeth at the bottom of the Stomach to which it is fa≈øtned, as al≈øo to the hollow ≈øide of the Liver and Spleen: The inner or backer Membrane ≈øprings from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> immediately under the Midriff towards the Back, and is tied to that part of the Gut <hi>Colon</hi> that pa≈ø≈øeth under the Stomach lengthways, as likewi≈øe to the Sweetbread and to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ≈ømall Gut, next to the lower Orifice of the Stomach. The≈øe Membranes are larded with plentifull Fat.</p>
                        <p>It is in figure like a Pur≈øe net, or Faulkner's Bag, con≈øi≈øting as is ≈øaid of a double Coat, ≈øeparate at the top, but knit together at the bottom, where it is round ≈øometimes, and ≈øometimes unequal, but at its upper part or orifice it is orbicular.</p>
                        <p>It has Ve≈ø≈øels of all ≈øorts, which do run through the ≈øub≈øtance thereof. It hath its Veins and Arteries from the Coeliacal and Me≈øenterical bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Nerves from a double branch of the Interco≈øtal pair.</p>
                        <p>In Hor≈øes it has much Fat, e≈øpecially in tho≈øe that are ≈øound and have not wa≈øted it by either ≈øickne≈øs or long fa≈øting, for in ≈øuch it con≈øi≈øts of little but the Membranes and Ve≈ø≈øels, the Fat ≈øerving for a ≈øub≈øidiary nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment to the natural heat to feed upon when the Bea≈øt eats nothing. Now this Fat is not di≈øtributed equally to all the parts of the Caul, but runs here and there in ≈øtreaks accordingly as the larger Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels do, the ≈øpaces between being wholly membranous and ≈øeemingly tran≈øparent, ≈øo that it imitates a Net, whence in ≈øome Countries they call it ≈øo. Now the Fat adhering to and accompanying the Ve≈ø≈øels in this manner, it ≈øeems to be bred of an unctuous or oily part of the Bloud that ≈øweats through the Ve≈ø≈øels, but is detained by the clo≈øene≈øs or den≈øene≈øs of the Membrane, by who≈øe re≈øpective coldne≈øs al≈øo it is curdled or congealed into Fat. But very unlikely it is that it ≈øhould be made of I know not what Vapours ≈øteaming out of the Parts contained in the Lower Belly, and conden≈øed by the≈øe Membranes; for not to mention the many ab≈øurdities of this Opinion, if it were ≈øo bred, then would all the Membranes be evenly and equally be≈ømeared with it, which it is obvious to any Eye that they are not.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of this plentifull Fat is to cheri≈øh and heat the bottom of the Stomach, the upper part of which has no need of its warmth, it being covered with the Liver, who≈øe Lobes hang over it and lie upon it. It ≈øerves al≈øo to moi≈øten the Guts, which have great need of being kept ≈ølippery and glib, that they may the better perform their continual peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaltick motion.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the Membranes or Skins be≈øides their congealing and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Fat, is to prop up and ≈øu≈øtain all the branches of the Ve≈ø≈øels which lie between and pa≈øs through them, to the Stomach, the Spleen, the beginning of the ≈ømall Gut, and <hi>Colon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>AFTER the Caul is removed, the Inte≈øtins or Guts do appear in their natural ≈øituation, as is ≈øhewed in the foregoing Figure; but there is another Part that lies ab≈øconded under them, which mu≈øt fir≈øt be ≈øpoken of according to the order of di≈ø≈øection, and that is the Stomach. It is ≈øingle in an Hor≈øe as it is in Man, though ≈øuch Creatures as have Horns, as Beeves, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øuch as having no Horns yet chew the Cud, as Camels, Hinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have four. This is the Kitchin of the Body and receptacle of Meat and Drink; as al≈øo the ≈øeat of Appetite, by rea≈øon of the Nerves that are di≈øper≈øed chiefly in its upper Orifice, but run in ≈ømall twigs al≈øo through its whole ≈øub≈øtance. It is called in Latin <hi>ventriculus,</hi> which is as much as to ≈øay a little Belly; and is placed or ≈øeated ju≈øt under the Midriff between the Liver and the Spleen, almo≈øt in the very middle of the Body, inclining a little towards the left Side that it might ballance the Body again≈øt the Liver, which is much bigger and heavier than the Spleen.</p>
                        <p>But before we enter upon the Stomach it is convenient fir≈øt to de≈øcribe the <hi>Gullet</hi> which is an Appendage to it, and ≈øerves as a Tunnel to convey the Food out of the Mouth into it, though the greate≈øt part of it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Neck and Brea≈øt.</p>
                        <p>It is an organical or di≈ø≈øimilar Part, hollow and round, beginning at the root of the Tongue, behind the head of the Windpipe, and pa≈ø≈øeth down from thence directly between the Windpipe and the Joints of the Neck and of the Che≈øt, about the fifth or ≈øixth Joint of which latter it turneth a little to the right ≈øide, to give way to the trunk of the great Artery, but about the ninth Joint it turns toward the left again and climbs upon the great Artery, and pa≈ø≈øing through the Midriff at an hole proper to it ≈øelf it is in≈øerted into the Stomach toward its left ≈øide, as you may ≈øee in the following Figure.</p>
                        <p>It con≈øi≈øts of three Membranes or Skins. The <hi>outermo≈øt</hi> is <hi>common,</hi>which it hath from the <hi>Pleura</hi> or from the ligaments of the Joints of the Neck and Brea≈øt on which it re≈øteth: This inve≈øteth the two <hi>proper.</hi> The <hi>middle</hi> or fir≈øt proper one is thick and fle≈øhy, con≈øi≈øting of two ranks of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57416:18"/>fle≈øhy Fibres, obliquely or ≈ølopingly a≈øcending and de≈øcending, ≈øo that they cro≈øs one another like an X. The innermo≈øt or ≈øecond proper is membranous, and hath onely ≈øtreight Fibres.</p>
                        <p>It has <hi>Veins</hi> in the Neck from the Jugulars, in the Brea≈øt from the <hi>Vein without a fellow;</hi> and where it is joined to the Stomach, from the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary branch of the <hi>Porta. Arteries</hi> in the Neck it has from the <hi>Carotides,</hi> in the Brea≈øt from the Interco≈øtals; and where it joins to the Stomach, from the coeliack coronary branch. It hath <hi>Nerves</hi> from that pair that is commonly called the ≈øixth.</p>
                        <p>It has two notable Glands or Kernels at its beginning in the Throat,called Almonds from their ≈øhape, which ≈øeparate a kind of ≈ølegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to keep the in≈øide of the Gullet moi≈øt and glib, that the Food may ea≈øilier de≈øcend down by it.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is, to convey Meat after it is chewed in the Mouth, as likewi≈øe Drink, down into the Stomach, there to be turned into chyle.</p>
                        <p>Having done with the Gullet, we now return to the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its <hi>figure</hi> is round and ≈øomewhat long, re≈øembling a Bag-pipe; though on the left ≈øide and at the bottom it is bunching and more capacious than on the right ≈øide; for there it is by little and little narrowed that it might give place to the Liver.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>magnitude</hi> is divers according to the largene≈øs of the Hor≈øe, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity of Meat or Drink (be it little or much) that is in it; for it contracteth or di≈øtendeth it ≈øelf as there is occa≈øion. As for example, if there be a great quantity of Meat and Drink let into it, it doth extend it ≈øelf to that largene≈øs as to contain it; and as that Meat is by little and little concocted, and then let forth through the lower Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice into the ≈ømall Guts to be there ≈øuckt up by the milky Veins, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach doth accordingly by little and little contract or draw it ≈øelf up ≈øo clo≈øe to that which remains, that it embraceth it on all ≈øides, ≈øo that there is never any cavity or hollowne≈øs to ≈øpeak of to be found in the Stomach; whence we ≈øee in Tripes, that the in≈øide is by ≈øuch contracting always rugged or in wrinkles, whereas the out≈øide is ≈ømooth and plain. Onely this we may note as to its bigne≈øs, that in con≈øideration of the bigne≈øs of an Hor≈øes Body or the largene≈øs of his Guts, it is far le≈øs in him than in mo≈øt Animals.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach hath two <hi>Orifices,</hi> a left and upper, which is to receive in Meat; and a right which is the lower, to let it out after concoction. The fir≈øt being the uppermo≈øt I will fir≈øt ≈øpeak of, which is much wider and larger than the other, becau≈øe it admits the Meat, many times not half chewed, into the Stomach (and for that cau≈øe is much thicker and al≈øo ≈øtronger than the other) whereas all is reduced into a fluid ≈øub≈øtance, before it pa≈øs out at the other.</p>
                        <p>This Orifice being a continuation of the Gullet is called the <hi>mouth</hi> of the Stomach, and hath an exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe of feeling becau≈øe of the Nerves which encompa≈øs it, and by which it the ≈øooner perceives the emptine≈øs and want of Meat, and therefore ≈øtirs up the Hor≈øe to ≈øeek Food to ≈øatisfy his want. It is near the middle of the Stomach, and not ≈øo near the left ≈øide of it as in Men.</p>
                        <p>It is furni≈øhed with fle≈øhy and circular Fibres, that it may naturally ≈øhut up and ≈øtraiten it ≈øelf after the Meat is received in, and al≈øo may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept or hinder the Vapours from coming forth, which would by their a≈øcent up to the Brain be very injurious, by breeding di≈øea≈øes and evil
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57416:18"/>di≈øtempers in the Head; which Vapours would be al≈øo wanted in the Stomach to further concoction: for as it is an u≈øual cu≈øtom when Meat is over the fire for the Pot-lid to be put on to keep the Vapours or Reek from coming forth; ≈øo likewi≈øe it is requi≈øite in this ca≈øe that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Stomach ≈øhould be kept in, that Concoction ≈øhould be thereby furthered, or the Food be ≈øooner dige≈øted, the Vapours a≈ø≈øi≈øting thereunto.</p>
                        <p>The lower and right Orifice is called <hi>pylorus,</hi> which is to ≈øay, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,from its office, which is to open and ≈øhut as occa≈øion ≈øerves; to open, when the chyle is let forth and ≈øent into the Gut <hi>duodenum,</hi> and then to contract or draw it ≈øelf clo≈øe up again, that nothing may pa≈øs through it which is not fully concocted. Which contraction is performed by tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe or overthwart Fibres, with which it is plentifully furni≈øhed for that purpo≈øe; as al≈øo a thick and compact circle doth encompa≈øs it round, which circle is in ≈øhape like the ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle of the Fundament. By the≈øe Fibres and this Circle the action of the Porter, or lower Orifice, is performed, that is to ≈øay, it is either opened or ≈øhut, widened or ≈øtraitned as there is occa≈øion, as I have ≈øaid before. And the≈øe are the offices of the Orifices of the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>Now I proceed to the <hi>compo≈øition</hi> of it, which is of three Membranes or Skins, the fir≈øt or outmo≈øt of which it hath from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> or Rim of the Belly. The ≈øecond and middlemo≈øt is more fle≈øhy than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, con≈øi≈øting of fle≈øhy Fibres, which do mightily ≈øtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and by their heat do further concoction. The third and inmo≈øt is nervous, into which all the Ve≈ø≈øels do terminate or end. This Coat or Skin is continued with the Gullet up to the Mouth, that the Mouth ≈øhould not admit or receive in any thing that is offen≈øive to the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach is furni≈øhed with <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of all ≈øorts. <hi>Veins</hi> it hath <hi>fir≈øt</hi> from the Splenick branch, as 1. The <hi>vas breve,</hi> or ≈øhort Vein, which is in≈øerted into the bottom of the Stomach, whence afterwards it creeps up between the Coats towards the upper Orifice, but is obliterated before it comes quite to it. 2. The two Ga≈øtrick Veins (the greater and le≈øs) which creep along the bottom of the Stomach, and in their cour≈øe ≈øpread many branches into it; but the large≈øt branch of the greater of the≈øe two is that which is called the Crown-vein, that encompa≈ø≈øes the upper Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomach. 3. A Vein that is common to the left ≈øide of the Stomach and the Caul. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it hath another common to its right ≈øide and the Caul, from the Me≈øenterick branch. And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> its lower or right Orifice has a ≈ømall Vein from the trunk of the <hi>Porta</hi> it ≈øelf, which is called <hi>pylorica</hi> or Porter-vein. Now before the circulation of the bloud was found out, it was believed that all the≈øe Veins brought bloud to the Stomach for its nouri≈øhment: but ≈øince that was di≈øcovered by Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> every one knows that they carry nothing to the Stomach, but bring back from it ≈øo much of the Arterial bloud as is not ≈øpent upon its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment. But be≈øides the bloud ≈øome learned Men have entertained an opinion that they ≈øuck out of the Stomach a thinner and more ≈øpirituous part of the chyle, which pa≈ø≈øes along with the bloud to the Heart by a far ≈øhorter pa≈ø≈øage than if it de≈øcended into the Guts and entred into the milky Veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as ≈øhall afterwards be fullier declared.) And this they think it rea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe, becau≈øe of the ≈øudden and quick refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Creatures receive from Cordial Drinks, and the like. I ≈øhall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57416:19"/>not pretend to decide the controver≈øie betwixt tho≈øe that affirm this, and others that deny it, but do think this opinion to be very probable, becau≈øe of the very ≈øpeedy revival of Hor≈øes (that I have ob≈øerved) which being ready to faint away, have ≈øuddenly grown brisk upon the giving them ≈øome comfortable draught: unle≈øs we ≈øhould think with ≈øome, that the Nerves of the Stomach do imbibe ≈øome ≈øpirituous parts of ≈øuch potions, and ≈øo the refre≈øhment ≈øhould come that way.</p>
                        <p>The Stomachal <hi>Arteries</hi> are twigs from the Coeliacal branch of the <hi>Arteria magna</hi> or great Arterie, and the≈øe do accompany the Veins in all their cour≈øe, and be≈øtow nouri≈øhment and vital heat upon it. For the Stomach is not nouri≈øhed with the Chyle, any more than any other part, but with arterial bloud which by the≈øe Arteries is brought from the Heart.</p>
                        <p>It hath two notable <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ≈øixth pair (reckoned by Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> to be the eighth) propagated from tho≈øe branches which make the recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nerves. The≈øe do encompa≈øs the upper Orifice, and then are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, in oblique or ≈ølanting lines, cro≈øs one another over mo≈øt part of it; the right branch compa≈ø≈øing the foremo≈øt and left part, and the left branch compa≈ø≈øing the hindermo≈øt and right part thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach has ≈øeveral <hi>Actions,</hi> as fir≈øt Hunger and Thir≈øt, which are the ≈øen≈øe that it has of the want of Meat and Drink, and an Appetite that is excited in it for the obtaining of them. Secondly, it has an action of retention, whereby it contracts it ≈øelf clo≈øe about the Food that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and detains it ≈øo long till it is throughly concocted or turned into a thin juice called Chyle. Thirdly, it has a motion that is called peri≈øtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ≈øuch as the Guts al≈øo have, re≈øembling the motion of a Worm, whereby its parts contracting them≈øelves ≈øucce≈ø≈øively from above down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, thru≈øt out the chyle into the Guts gently and by degrees. But the chief and mo≈øt con≈øiderable action of the Stomach, is, fourthly, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, or turning the aliment into a whiti≈øh liquor commonly known by the name of Chyle, which being expelled out of the Stomach into the Guts, is, the <hi>thinner</hi> part of it, ≈øuckt up by a ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øels called <hi>milky</hi> Veins, (≈øo called from that colour which this liquor gives them) that are in≈øerted every where into the Guts, and which carry it towards the Heart, by tho≈øe ways that hereafter ≈øhall be de≈øcribed: but the thicker and more dreggy part is driven along the Guts and ca≈øt out at the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as excrement.</p>
                        <p>Now there are ≈øeveral things that concur to this la≈øt and principal action of the Stomach, <hi>viz.</hi> Concoction. As <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> the very numerous Arteries that are di≈øper≈øed through it which much fo≈øter and encrea≈øe its <hi>heat,</hi> which though it be not the main in≈øtrument of concoction, yet much furthers it. And this heat is al≈øo encrea≈øed by the Liver which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the upper and fore-part of its right ≈øide, as al≈øo by the Caul which by its two Membranes inve≈øts its bottom. But <hi>≈øecondly,</hi> that to which concoction is mainly owing is a certain ferment in the Stomach, which is compounded <hi>partly</hi> of the ≈ølaver with which the Hor≈øes mouth always abounds for the moi≈øtening and ≈øoftning of his Meat while he chews it, and part of which is continually ≈øwallow'd down into his Stomach toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Food; and <hi>partly</hi> of an acid or ≈øharp and ≈øalt liquor bred in the Stomach, as is mo≈øt likely, of ≈øalt and acid ≈øteams evaporating out of the ≈øtomachal Arteries, and conden≈øed in it into this juice: And this liquor is that which di≈ø≈øolves and melts as it were the ≈øolid Meats that are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57416:20"/>≈øwallowed (≈øomething like as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> di≈ø≈øolves Steel) and reduces the whole ma≈øs into fluid ≈øub≈øtance, which then pa≈ø≈øes down into the Guts, as above≈øaid. This acid Juice was formerly thought to come from the Spleen by a Vein called <hi>the ≈øhort Ve≈ø≈øel;</hi> but later Anatomi≈øts have di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the circulation of the Bloud, that that Vein brings nothing from the Spleen to the Stomach, but contrariwi≈øe carries the Bloud, that is ≈øuperfluous to the nouri≈øhment of the Stomach, from it into the ≈øple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Vein, by which it goes to the Liver, and from thence to the Heart in its circulation. So that no ≈øuch original or ≈øpring of this ferment is to be imagined.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Guts are called in Latin <hi>Inte≈øtina,</hi> becau≈øe they are placed in the inmo≈øt part of the Body, as you ≈øee them placed in the Third Figure, which ≈øhews their natural po≈øition or ≈øituation, they taking up the mo≈øt part of the cavity or hollowne≈øs of the Lower Belly. They are oblong, round, hollow Bodies, in number ≈øix, and are bigger or le≈ø≈øer as is the bigne≈øs of the Hor≈øe. They are the In≈øtruments of di≈øtribution of the Chyle and expul≈øion of the Ordure, being continued with the <hi>Pylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> or Porter of the Stomach and reaching to the Fundament. They are in length about thirty ≈øix yards, a little under or over according to the largene≈øs of the Hor≈øe; wherefore they are nece≈ø≈øarily girded and wound into manifold convolutions or folds, that the cavity of the Lower Belly might be capable of containing them, which otherwi≈øe it could not do.</p>
                        <p>They are gathered up and entwi≈øted in the folds of the Me≈øentery, by which coming between they are al≈øo knit to the Back: all which is to keep them from falling out of their places or rolling upon one another, which would have often hapned, had not Nature ≈øo well provided for the contrary, e≈øpecially in violent exerci≈øe, as hunting, running, leaping and the like; and if it had hapned, the weight of the one lying upon the other would have ob≈øtructed the pa≈ø≈øage of the Excrements, and ≈øo caus'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øive pains, as gripings, ≈øtrainings to dung, and the like, and upon the continuance of ≈øuch ≈øtoppage, death it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>The Guts are on the out≈øide mo≈øt times fat, but on the in≈øide they are covered with a ≈ølimy or ≈ønotty ≈øub≈øtance, for the more free and glib pa≈ø≈øage of the Dung.</p>
                        <p>They have <hi>three Coats,</hi> like as the Stomach hath. The <hi>outermo≈øt</hi> or common one is nervous, ≈øpringing mediately from the Rim of the Belly, but immediately from the Membranes of the Me≈øentery; ≈øaving that of the beginning of the fir≈øt Gut, and of that part of the <hi>Colon</hi> which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth under the Stomach, where it immediately proceedeth from the Caul adhering to tho≈øe Parts. The <hi>middle</hi> is thicker and fle≈øhy, having two ranks of Fibres, the outer of them ≈øtreight, and the inner tran≈øver≈øe or overthwart. The <hi>innermo≈øt</hi> is al≈øo nervous like the outmo≈øt, but on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide it is cru≈øted over with a kind of ≈øpongy ≈øub≈øtance, that ≈øerves as a ≈øtrainer for the Chyle to pa≈øs through out of the Guts into the milky Veins. This Coat has all forts of Fibres, and is very wrinkled, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the too quick gliding away of the Ghyle. The Fibres of this and the middle Coat ≈øerve to perform the peri≈øtaltick or worm-like motion of the Guts, by which what≈øoever is contained in them is gently driven along downwards towards the Fundament.</p>
                        <p>The Guts have all ≈øorts of Ve≈ø≈øels. As 1. <hi>Veins.</hi> The≈øe they have from ≈øeveral branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> but the mo≈øt come from that branch of it that is called the Me≈øenterick. The u≈øe of which Veins was by the Ancients thought to be, both to carry Bloud to them from the Liver for their nouri≈øhment, and to bring back from them the Chyle to the Liver,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57416:21"/>there to be turned into bloud. But as to the fir≈øt, the circulation of the Bloud makes it evident, that they carry no bloud to the Guts, but all that is contained in them, is received from the Arteries that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted into the Inte≈øtins, and returns by them to the Liver, through which it pa≈ø≈øes into the Vein called <hi>Cava,</hi> and by it a≈øcends to the Heart. And as to the latter u≈øe a≈ø≈øigned to the≈øe Veins, namely the bringing of Chyle from the Guts to the Liver, there was another ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øels found out by one <hi>A≈øellius</hi> about three≈øcore years agoe, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this office, called by him (from their colour) <hi>milky Veins.</hi> But neither do the≈øe conveigh the Chyle to the Liver, as the fir≈øt Inventor of them thought, but running from the circumference of the Me≈øentery they unite and di≈øcharge them≈øelves into one common receptacle near its centre at the Back-bone, from whence the Chyle pa≈ø≈øes up along the ≈øide of the Back-bone as high as the Collar-bone by a proper pipe, where it is emptied into the ≈øubclavian Vein, in which being mixed with the Bloud it glides along with it immediately into the Heart. I ≈øay then the u≈øe of the Bloud-veins of the Guts, is onely to receive ≈øo much of the Arterial bloud as is ≈øuperfluous from their nouri≈øhment.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>≈øecond</hi> ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øel di≈øper≈øed through the Guts are the <hi>Arteries,</hi> which ≈øpring partly from the Coeliack branch, and partly from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenterick. The≈øe afford both Vital heat and nouri≈øhment to the Guts, and be≈øides upon admini≈øtring a Drench to ≈øcour your Hor≈øe, they di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the impurities and bad humours flowing in the ma≈øs of bloud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guts, to be thrown out in the draught.</p>
                        <p>3. Their <hi>Nerves</hi> are from that pair that has commonly been called the ≈øixth, but according to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s di≈øtinction is now generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for the ninth pair, and otherwi≈øe called the <hi>Interco≈øtal,</hi> becau≈øe as it de≈øcends down the Che≈øt, it ≈øends out a ≈ømall twig between every Rib. The≈øe contribute to the Guts their ≈øen≈øe of feeling, and furni≈øh their Fibres with animal Spirits, whereby they are enabled to perform their worm-like motion.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>milky Veins,</hi> we have mention'd them before, and ≈øhall treat further of them in the Chapter of the <hi>Me≈øentery.</hi>

                        <p>NOW though the Guts be one continued Body from the lower Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomach to the Fundament, yet they are wont to be di≈øtingui≈øhed into ≈øeveral; In Men they are divided into ≈øix, three ≈ømall, and three thick: but in a Hor≈øe we cannot ≈øo well follow this divi≈øion, there being not any difference in the ≈ømall Guts ≈øo con≈øiderable as to ground a di≈øtinction upon. However, becau≈øe the ≈øecond of the thick Guts ≈øeems to have three partitions, we ≈øhall make three of it, and ≈øo will they an≈øwer to the number in Men, and be reckoned <hi>≈øix.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57416:22"/>
                        <p>The fir≈øt we ≈øhall di≈øtingui≈øh onely by the name of the <hi>≈ømall Gut.</hi> This is twenty ≈øix or twenty ≈øeven yards in length, ≈øomething narrower at a foot and half di≈øtance from the Stomach than towards its ending, but through the whole it is wider than in an Oxe, being about two inches or two and an half over. Pre≈øently at its beginning it bends under the Stomach towards the Back-bone, ≈øtreight along which it de≈øcends a pretty way, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed firmly to it by a ≈øtrong Membrane (that ≈øeems to be borrow'd of the Caul here knit to it) which is all the e≈øtabli≈øhment it has. But by and by it leaves this hold, and beginning to wind about, is received into the folds of the Me≈øentery, whereby it is admirably kept from twi≈øting and entanglement. Now there are far more of the <hi>milky Veins</hi> in≈øerted into this Gut than into all that follow; and be≈øides tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which are common to it with the thick Guts, namely Veins, Arteries and Nerves, it has two other Ve≈ø≈øels in≈øerted into it, one from the Liver and another from the Sweet-bread. By the fir≈øt is yellow Choler, and by the latter a peculiar Juice from the Sweet-bread (called the <hi>pancreatick Juice</hi>) di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged into it. The≈øe two Liquors flowing into it from the afore≈øaid Bowels about a foot below the Stomach, within an inch or two one of another, make a notable ferment in it, which mixing with the Chyle that is pa≈ø≈øing down this way, cau≈øes it al≈øo to ferment, whereby it comes to work it ≈øelf ≈øomething clearer, as I may ≈øay, even as Ale or Beer in a Barrel does. For by this fermentation the impurer and more earthy or dreggy part of the Chyle, is ≈øeparated and precipitated as it were from the more pure and ≈øpirituous, whereby this latter part is made capable of being received in at the ≈ømall mouths of the milky Veins that gape in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance into this Gut, whil≈øt the thicker and excrementitious part is thru≈øt along the Guts by their worm-like motion, and makes the Dung. This Gut for about two hands breadth at its beginning from the <hi>Pylorus</hi> is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and for the like ≈øpace at its end before it is joined to the following, is a little narrower, than in its other parts.</p>
                        <p>Having done with the <hi>≈ømall Gut,</hi> we next come to the <hi>thick</hi> ones, in number five, of which the fir≈øt is called <hi>Caecum</hi> or the <hi>blind Gut,</hi> becau≈øe it has but one pa≈ø≈øage for the Excrements both into and out of it, which come into it out of the ≈ømall Gut, and go out of it into the next thick Gut. It is not round in ≈øhape like the ≈ømall Gut, but as it were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øquare, which figure it comes to have from four Ligaments that run along it, one on each ≈øide, which contain it in that ≈øhape; and the≈øe Ligaments being ≈øhorter than its Coats, make them bag out in many Cells as the <hi>Colon</hi> does in other Creatures. It is almo≈øt a yard long, and unequal in breadth: for though at its mouth, where it joyns to the ≈ømall Gut and the <hi>Colon,</hi> it be near a quarter of a yard over, yet towards its clo≈øe end it grows ≈øo by degrees narrower, that it is not above three inches. This Gut is very incon≈øiderable for its bigne≈øs in mo≈øt Creatures, particularly in Man, in whom it is not ordinarily above four inches long, and hardly ≈øo thick as ones little Finger: onely in a Rabbit it bears much the ≈øame proportion with the re≈øt of the Guts, as it does in an Hor≈øe. In ≈øuch Creatures as have it ≈øo very ≈ømall, its u≈øe is very ob≈øcure; but in an Hor≈øe where it is ≈øo very large, its u≈øe is apparent to be, to ≈øtay the too quick pa≈ø≈øage of the Excrements by receiving them into it ≈øelf as it were into an Inn, whereas if they kept directly the ≈øtreight Road of the re≈øt of the Guts without turning in here, they would come too ≈øoon to their journeys end, namely the Fundament: I mean the Hor≈øe would be continually
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57416:22"/>a-≈øcouring, and ≈øo fall from his fle≈øh and langui≈øh, by rea≈øon that the <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Veins</hi> would not have time to ≈øuck up all the Chyle out of the Guts to turn into his nouri≈øhment; be≈øides that it would be trouble≈øome to the Hor≈øe, and offen≈øive to his Rider to have him always a-dunging. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion to the ≈ømall Gut and <hi>Colon</hi> you may better conceive of by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Figure, in which it is well expre≈ø≈øed, than by my de≈øcription of it in words.</p>
                        <p>That which is the ≈øecond thick Gut and in Man is called the <hi>Colon,</hi> ≈øeems in an Hor≈øe to be divided into three, to which I ≈øhall not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to a≈ø≈øign di≈øtinct names, but onely call them three <hi>Colons.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of them is about a yard and a half in length, and for the mo≈øt part of it a quarter of a yard over. The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is as wide as the fir≈øt, but onely about a yard in length. The≈øe two are divided one from the other by a narrow <hi>neck</hi> about half a yard long, and four inches over. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the≈øe two wide <hi>Colons,</hi> is that which in its upper part joyns with the blind Gut above de≈øcribed, where it has a Valve, con≈øi≈øting of a loo≈øe Membrane or Skin that hangs round its mouth, which permits any thing to come into the <hi>Colon</hi> out of the <hi>Caecum</hi> or out of the ≈ømall Gut, but when any thing would pa≈øs out of that into the≈øe, then the edges of this loo≈øe Skin flap clo≈øe one again≈øt another and hinder it, whereby Nature has prevented the return of the Excrements back out of the <hi>Colon</hi> into the ≈ømall Gut. And the lower end of the <hi>latter</hi> of the≈øe two wide <hi>Colons</hi> joins to the <hi>third,</hi> which is very narrow in compari≈øon of <hi>them,</hi> but yet is more than twice as long as both of them, namely about ≈øix yards. Now all the≈øe three <hi>Colons</hi> are contracted into Cells by two Ligaments, one of which runs along the upper part, and the other on the lower ≈øide of them: and be≈øides the≈øe two which are common to them all, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ones have ≈øomewhere other two that run along their ≈øides, but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ≈øo has the Neck that divides them whereby it is made four≈øquare like the blind Gut. The rea≈øon why the≈øe <hi>Colons</hi> (as well as they are in other Creatures, and the <hi>Caecum</hi> al≈øo in this) are contracted into Cells, is for the ≈ølower pa≈ø≈øage of the Excrements, that what of the Chyle was not drunk in by the milky Veins of the ≈ømall Gut, might be lei≈øurely ≈øuckt up by tho≈øe that are in≈øerted into the≈øe thick ones; for though we call their Contents <hi>Excrements,</hi> yet that is onely becau≈øe the much greater part is ≈øo, for all the Chyle is not clear imbibed from them till they come towards the end of the la≈øt <hi>Colon,</hi> though the milky Veins are not a tenth part ≈øo numerous in the≈øe as in the ≈ømall Gut.</p>
                        <p>To the lower end of the ≈ømall <hi>Colon</hi> is joined the la≈øt Gut called <hi>Rectum</hi> or the <hi>≈øtreight</hi> Gut, becau≈øe it runs ≈øtreight along without any windings. It is al≈øo called the <hi>Ar≈øe-gut,</hi> becau≈øe it reacheth to the Fundament. The Coats of this Gut, e≈øpecially the middle, are much thicker than any of the other, and the whole ≈øeems fle≈øhy and mu≈øcular. It is but about half a yard long, and betwixt three and four inches over. This is not gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the foldings of the Me≈øentery, but in≈øtead of that, is from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the lower end of the Loins, to its ending at the Ar≈øe-hole, fa≈øt tied by a Membrane to the Back and Rump-bones, which keep it from falling out upon ≈øtraining to dung. At its lower end at the Ar≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole it has a round Mu≈øcle that encompa≈ø≈øes it, called the <hi>≈øphincter</hi> Mu≈øcle, whereby it is pur≈øed up ≈øo, that nothing can pa≈øs out, except when the Bea≈øt loo≈øens it of his own accord when he goes to dung, and then at the ≈øame time he ≈øqueezes the Guts by help of the Mu≈øcles that environ his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57416:23"/>Paunch, which we de≈øcribed above in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. and ≈øo forces the Dung to i≈ø≈øue out at the Fundament.</p>
                        <p>And thus we have fini≈øhed the Hi≈øtory of the Guts, not needing to add any thing of the u≈øe of them, becau≈øe their u≈øe is all along interwoven in their de≈øcription, and therefore we ≈øhall pa≈øs on to the other parts.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Me≈øentery.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Me≈øenterium</hi> or <hi>Me≈øentery</hi> is ≈øo called from its being placed in the middle of the Guts, which it embraces round, gathering them together in form of a Globe, but is it ≈øelf gathered into folds. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery is of a circular figure, compo≈øed of a double Coat, between which do run many Ve≈ø≈øels and tho≈øe of all ≈øorts, and betwixt which al≈øo there is a collection of much fat. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ≈øays that in <hi>Man</hi> there is a third Membrane betwixt the two commonly known, in which are ≈øeated the Glands or Kernels, and through which the Ve≈ø≈øels run. If ≈øo, 'tis likely there is the ≈øame in an <hi>Hor≈øes</hi> Me≈øentery, which abounds with Glands. 'Tis a little above a quarter of a yard broad from its centre to its circum≈øerence.</p>
                        <p>Now its <hi>centre</hi> or <hi>ri≈øe</hi> is at the fir≈øt and third Rack-bone of the Loins, where membranous Fibres are produced from the Rim of the Belly, and ≈øpread into the two inve≈øting Coats or Skins of the Me≈øentery.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fat</hi> with which the≈øe Membranes are ≈øtuft, is collected in the ≈øame manner as that of the Caul above-de≈øcribed in <hi>chap.</hi> 8. namely the oily part of the Bloud ≈øweating out of the Arteries that run in abundance between the≈øe Membranes, is ≈øtopt by them, (they being more compact and clo≈øe than the Coats of the Arteries) and by their re≈øpective coldne≈øs is congealed into fat.</p>
                        <p>There are almo≈øt innumerable Ve≈ø≈øels running through it, but ≈øuch as are rather ≈øu≈øtained and conducted by it, than for its own u≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt ≈øort are the <hi>Veins,</hi> to which it gives the denomination of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaraick.</hi> The≈øe are all branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> and their office is to receive ≈øo much of the Arterial bloud as is not ≈øpent on the nouri≈øhment of the Guts and Me≈øentery, and to convey it to the Liver, and from thence to the Heart. Before the <hi>milky Veins</hi> were found out, it was believed they brought the Chyle to the Liver; but that opinion is now out of doors, as we have more fully ≈øhewn before in the tenth Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Arteries</hi> al≈øo from its name are called <hi>Me≈øaraick</hi> or <hi>Me≈øenterick;</hi> the≈øe run in great numbers through it to the Guts, to which what office they perform was likewi≈øe declar'd above, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. And be≈øides the u≈øes there a≈øcribed to them, they continually ≈øupply new oily Vapours for the maintenance of the ≈øat of the Me≈øentery.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Nerves</hi> are very numerous, and ≈øpring from that pair which is now (from Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>) commonly called the <hi>Interco≈øtal,</hi> and reckoned for the ninth pair, but was formerly reputed the ≈øixth.</p>
                        <p>All the <hi>venae lacteae</hi> or <hi>milky Veins</hi> run through it from the Guts towards its centre. The≈øe are very ≈ølender and almo≈øt tran≈øparent Ve≈ø≈øels, having but one ≈øingle Coat, and gaping with their mouths in the inmo≈øt Coat of the Guts do there ≈øuck up the Chyle, and take the neare≈øt cour≈øe thence to tho≈øe Glands or Kernels of the Me≈øentery that are next to them, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ≈ømaller in their pa≈ø≈øage growing into one greater. From the ≈øeveral ≈ømaller Glands they proceed to the greate≈øt that is placed at the Back at the centre of the Me≈øentery, and from thence to the common receptacle
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57416:25"/>that is ≈øeated betwixt the Kidneys. What cour≈øe it takes from thence the Reader may ≈øee in the already twice mentioned tenth Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides all the≈øe ≈øorts of Ve≈ø≈øels there was a fifth ≈øort found out by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bartholin</hi> (a Dane) ≈øome thirty years ago, which indeed are to be found in mo≈øt parts of the Body, but mo≈øt abound in the Me≈øentery, and are called <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> as much as to ≈øay, Water-pa≈ø≈øages. Their Coat is ≈øingle as that of the milky Veins, but more tran≈øparent; and the <hi>lympha</hi> or water that is contained in them, is very clear. This Liquor differs from the <hi>≈øerum</hi> or wheyi≈øh watery part of the Bloud, which one may di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by this Experiment; If you take a little of this Liquor into a Spoon, it will ≈øoon thicken into a gelly of its own accord, which the <hi>≈øerum</hi> of the Bloud will not do unle≈øs you heat it over the fire. It is ≈øuppo≈øed to be made of thin moi≈øt Vapours of the Bloud, which being conden≈øed into water, are imbibed by the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels. All tho≈øe that run through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery di≈øcharge their water into the common receptacle of the Chyle above-mentioned, ≈øo that it pa≈ø≈øes together with the Chyle up the pa≈ø≈øage that a≈øcends by the Back towards the Shoulders, and there mixes with the Bloud in the ≈øubclavian Vein.</p>
                        <p>In the middle Membrane of the Me≈øentery (fir≈øt found out by Doctor <hi>Wharton</hi> as above≈øaid) there are a great many <hi>Glands</hi> or <hi>Kernels,</hi> into which the milky Veins as they pa≈øs through the Me≈øentery are in≈øerted, and then ri≈øe out of them again, continuing their cour≈øe to the one great Gland at its centre, in which they all meet together, and from it hold on their way to the common receptacle as was above-declared. By the≈øe Glands the ≈øaid Veins are ≈øupported and ≈øtrengthened in their pa≈ø≈øage.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Me≈øentery is to be as it were a tie or band to the Guts to bind or gather them together, and to fa≈øten them to the Back, that their great weight do not cau≈øe them in violent motion either to break or twi≈øt or roll confu≈øedly one over the other, whereby their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worm-like motion would be hindred, if not perverted or aboli≈øhed. And be≈øides by its Membranes and Glands it does guard and ≈øu≈øtain the ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels who≈øe way lies through it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Pancreas why ≈øo called. Its ≈øituation. Its ≈øub≈øtance. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its proper pa≈ø≈øage. Its <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe. The Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Juice.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Sweet-bread</hi> is an un≈øhapely body, of a glandulous yet fle≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ≈øub≈øtance, from whence it hath its name <hi>Pancreas</hi> which ≈øignifies <hi>all fle≈øh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In di≈ø≈øection it is at the end of the Liver and bottom of the Stomach; but while the Hor≈øe is living, it is ≈øituated on the back≈øide of the bottom of the Stomach, and lies cro≈øs the Belly lengthways as that does.</p>
                        <p>Its proper fle≈øh is white and ≈øoft, but the little Kernels with which it is plentifully ≈øtored, are of a more reddi≈øh colour. It is covered with a ≈øingle Membrane which it has from the Rim of the Belly, as all the Bowels of the Lower Belly have, of which it is almo≈øt the lea≈øt.</p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57416:25"/>
                        <p>It has <hi>Veins</hi> from that branch of the <hi>Porta</hi> that runs to the Spleen, and is called the Splenick. Its <hi>Arteries</hi> ≈øpring from the Coeliacal; and its <hi>Nerves</hi> from the Interco≈øtal or ninth pair. This Bowel for its bigne≈øs has very many of tho≈øe Lympheducts that we de≈øcribed in the foregoing Chapter running through the Me≈øentery.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which are common to it with other parts, it has a pipe or pa≈ø≈øage peculiar to it ≈øelf, which was fir≈øt found out at <hi>Padua</hi> in an humane Body about forty years ago. This pa≈ø≈øage is membranous, and though it be but one in its going out, yet within the Sweet-bread it is divided fir≈øt into two, and tho≈øe two into innumerable ≈ømall branches which are di≈øper≈øed all over its Body, but their extremities terminate in the above≈øaid reddi≈øh Kernels with which the Sweet-bread abounds.</p>
                        <p>Before this pa≈ø≈øage was found out, ≈øome thought the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread to be only to ≈øerve as a Cu≈øhion (being very ≈øoft) for the Stomach to bol≈øter upon, and to ≈øu≈øtain the Ve≈ø≈øels that run through it; and others, that it ≈øent a ferment to the Stomach to a≈ø≈øi≈øt concoction. As to this latter u≈øe it mu≈øt needs be onely imaginary, ≈øeeing there is no pa≈ø≈øage from it to the Stomach. And as to the former, though it doe tho≈øe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mentioned, yet from its proper pa≈ø≈øage (which opens into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ≈ømall Gut very near the ≈øame place where the Gall-pa≈ø≈øage enters) it gives ≈øu≈øpicion that it has a further u≈øe. Now ≈øome have been ≈øo curious as to open Dogs alive, and cutting off this pa≈ø≈øage where it is in≈øerted into the Gut, to receive its end into a narrow-mouth'd Ve≈ø≈øel, (you may ≈øee the manner of it in <hi>Barthol.</hi> Anat. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13.) into which Ve≈ø≈øel in a few hours time there has a Spoonfull of Juice de≈øtilled out of it. And this Juice, to di≈øtingui≈øh it from all other Liquors in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they call the <hi>Pancreatick juice,</hi> from the name <hi>Pancreas</hi> whereby the Sweet-bread is otherwi≈øe called. So that it ≈øeems there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Liquor ≈øeparated from the Arteries into this pa≈ø≈øage in the little Kernels or Glands above-≈øpoken of, which tho≈øe that have ta≈øted it, ≈øay, is of a ≈øalti≈øh and ≈øomewhat ≈øowri≈øh ta≈øte. Now this Juice pa≈ø≈øing by its Pipe into the beginning of the ≈ømall Gut, meets there with the Gall, with which it ferments, and cau≈øes ≈øome fermentation in the Chyle as it de≈øcends that way, whereby its purer parts are ≈øeparated from the more impure and earthy, as was di≈øcour≈øed more fully in the eleventh Chapter, when we were de≈øcribing the ≈ømall Gut, (to which the Reader may plea≈øe to turn back.)</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>figure</hi> of the Sweet-bread, you have it expre≈øt in the next Table but one, namely in that wherein the Spleen is al≈øo de≈øcribed.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING now done with the Parts that mini≈øter to the fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, namely <hi>Chylification,</hi> we proceed to tho≈øe other that in ≈øome mea≈øure, ≈øome more ≈øome le≈øs, a≈ø≈øi≈øt <hi>Sanguification,</hi> of which the <hi>Liver</hi> was e≈øteemed by the Ancients the principal, nay almo≈øt the onely in≈øtrument. Which errour of theirs was founded on this mi≈øtake in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, That having not then found out the milky Veins which we have before de≈øcribed, they thought that the Chyle was received out of the Guts by the Me≈øaraick Veins, which being branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> all run to the Liver; And the <hi>Cava</hi> or large hollow Vein that ari≈øes out of the Liver, and is the trunk whence all the branches of Veins in the whole Body ≈øpring, containing nothing in it but bloud, it nece≈ø≈øarily follow'd that if the Chyle came to the Liver, it mu≈øt by it be turned into bloud before it departed from it again. Yea ≈øo deep was this Opinion of the Liver's making bloud fixed in Mens Brains, that for ≈øome while after the milky Veins were found out, they would needs have <hi>them</hi> to convey the Chyle to the Liver, though they were forced to a thou≈øand ≈øhifts to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for their non-appearance between the great Gland of the Me≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, (whither they might be ea≈øily traced) and the Liver. But this prejudice was ≈øoon overcome when about thirty years ago the common Receptacle (de≈øcribed before in the tenth and twelfth Chapters) was found out, and a new office was invented for the Liver, which yet may in ≈øome ≈øort be ≈øaid to a≈ø≈øi≈øt Sanguification: and what this office is, ≈øhall be ≈øhewn by and by in this and the next Chapters.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> of it is like concrete or congealed Bloud, for which cau≈øe it is called <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> which is to ≈øay an affu≈øion or ≈øhedding forth of bloud. It is one in number, and ≈øituated in the Lower Belly in the upper part thereof on the right ≈øide under the ≈øhort Ribs, near to the <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> or Midriff, in its upper ≈øide, and its lower lies upon the right and fore≈øide of the Stomach. It is divided into ≈øeveral Lobes or Flaps, in Hor≈øes, otherwi≈øe than in Men, in whom it is one continued body. The≈øe Lobes do cover the Stomach, gra≈øping of it (as it were) as one ≈øhould gra≈øp any thing with their hand by ≈øpreading their fingers about it. This covering the Stomach ≈øtands in great need of, for thereby is the heat thereof much cheri≈øhed for the furthering concoction. As for its <hi>≈øhape,</hi> you cannot ≈øo well conceive it by any de≈øcription, as by the figure of it annexed at the end of this Chapter, which you may plea≈øe to take a view of.</p>
                        <p>It is tied in its place by three Ligaments: the ≈øtronge≈øt of which is that which is called its <hi>≈øu≈øpen≈øory</hi> Ligament. This ≈øprings from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> where it is ≈øpread over the under ≈øide of the Midriff. It is very ≈øtrong and membranous, and ari≈øing from the Midriff ≈øomewhat towards its right ≈øide, it is in≈øerted into the upper or bunching ≈øide of the Liver, into which it enters a little way; but in its entrance it lo≈øes one of its Membranes, which dilating or ≈øpreading it ≈øelf makes the skin that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraps
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57416:26"/>wraps the whole Liver; for the Liver is onely covered with one thin skin which it has from this Ligament. There is a <hi>≈øecond</hi> Ligament which ≈øeems to ≈øpring from this skin of the Liver, and is in≈øerted into the ≈øharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Gri≈øtle at the bottom of the Brea≈øt-bone. By the≈øe two is the Liver kept from falling lower down into the Belly, or from ≈ølipping out of its place ≈øideways. The <hi>third</hi> Ligament is not one originally, but when the Foal is in the Womb it ≈øupplies the place of a Vein, running from the Navel to the lower or hollow ≈øide of the Liver, and by it is nouri≈øhment brought from the Dam to the Foal. But as ≈øoon as it is foaled, and it begins to take its nouri≈øhment by the mouth onely, and not any longer at all this way, this Vein dries and clo≈øes up, and ≈øo degenerates into a Ligament, whereby the Liver is kept from a≈øcending or bearing up again≈øt the Midriff, as it might have done in an Hor≈øes leaping or the like. This is ju≈øt oppo≈øite to the <hi>Su≈øpen≈øory</hi> one, entring in at the lower ≈øide over again≈øt where that does on the upper.</p>
                        <p>It hath two ≈øorts of <hi>Veins.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> are the roots of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> or large hollow Vein, which ≈øpreading them≈øelves through all its parts, do receive into them the bloud that is brought into the Liver by the <hi>Porta;</hi> which having done, the ≈ømaller roots two or three of them grow into one, and this one uniting with two or three of the like kind into another larger root, they do at la≈øt all of them meet in one trunk and make the hollow Vein, which i≈ø≈øuing out of the upper part of the Liver pre≈øently enters the Midriff, and ≈øo a≈øcends up to the Heart. The <hi>≈øecond</hi> ≈øort of Vein is the <hi>Porta,</hi> all who≈øe branches coming from the Guts, Spleen, Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and uniting into one trunk enter the Liver on its lower or hollow ≈øide, into which it is no ≈øooner entred, but pre≈øently it di≈øper≈øes it ≈øelf into innumerable branches through all the Lobes of the Liver, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording nouri≈øhment unto it, in that regard ≈øupplying the place of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which it re≈øembles the more, becau≈øe within the Liver it has two Coats, the outer whereof it receives from that skin that cloaths the Liver, in its entrance into it. Now ≈øo much of the bloud that is imported by the <hi>Porta,</hi> as is not ≈øpent on the nouri≈øhment of the Liver, is drunk in by the roots of the <hi>hollow Vein</hi> before-mentioned, and returned to the Heart. This Vein is called <hi>Porta</hi> or <hi>Vena portae,</hi> the Gate-vein, from two bunchings out, of the Liver, (called <hi>gates</hi> by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) between which it enters it.</p>
                        <p>Yet is not the Liver, at lea≈øt all the parts of it, onely nouri≈øhed by the bloud that is brought in by the <hi>Porta;</hi> for there is a branch which comes from the Coeliack Artery that a≈øcends to its hollow ≈øide ju≈øt by the <hi>Porta,</hi> which ≈øends forth twigs all over its Coat, as likewi≈øe through the Coats of the <hi>Porta</hi> and the Choler-Ve≈ø≈øels: but whether any of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into its parenchyma or ≈øub≈øtance, is not di≈øcovered. The≈øe twigs of Arteries bring vital heat and nouri≈øhment to tho≈øe parts through which they run.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Nerves</hi> ≈øpring from the Interco≈øtal pair, <hi>viz.</hi> partly from the ≈øtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick and partly from the me≈øenterick branch thereof. The≈øe onely are communicated to tho≈øe parts to which the Arteries are di≈øper≈øed, ≈øo that the ≈øub≈øtance of the Liver has very little ≈øen≈øe.</p>
                        <p>We ≈øhew'd before how that for ≈øome while after the milky Veins were found out, they were believ'd to convey the Chyle to the Liver: and all the colour for this Opinion was a few ≈ømall clear, limpid and almo≈øt tran≈øparent Ve≈ø≈øels, that run between the Me≈øentery and it. But as on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57416:27"/>the one hand they are too few in number for that office (e≈øpecially being ≈øo ≈ølender) being ≈øcarce one for ten of the milky Veins in the Me≈øentery: ≈øo on the other, they are neither of the ≈øame colour (as being much clearer) nor does the Liquor they contain come from the Me≈øentery to the Liver, but runs from this to that, as has been ob≈øerved in Live-di≈ø≈øections, in which having been tied they have ≈øwelled on that ≈øide of the Ligature toward the Liver, and grown empty toward the Me≈øentery. They are indeed then truly <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> which carry that water that is ≈øeparated from the bloud in the Liver, towards the Me≈øentery, and from it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receptacle of the Chyle with which it mixes.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels there are the numerous branches of the Gall-pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, of which we ≈øhall treat more fully in the next Chapter. And ≈øhall ≈øay no more here, but onely how one may di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Cava, Porta</hi> and the≈øe of the Gall-pa≈ø≈øage, ≈øo as to know which are which. Tho≈øe of the <hi>Cava</hi> are clad but with one Coat, are white, thin and of a large cavity. Tho≈øe of the <hi>Porta</hi> have a double Coat, and ≈øo are thicker and ≈øtronger, and yet not ≈øo wide as tho≈øe of the <hi>Cava.</hi> La≈øtly, the branches of the Gall-pa≈ø≈øage are of a duski≈øh yellow, have a thicker Coat than either the <hi>Cava</hi> or <hi>Porta,</hi> and yet have the narrowe≈øt channel. The≈øe are included in a common ca≈øe with tho≈øe of the <hi>Porta,</hi> which makes their outer Coat.</p>
                        <p>Having in the beginning of this Chapter detected the errour of the Ancients in a≈øcribing Sanguification to the Liver in ≈øo eminent and large a ≈øen≈øe; we mu≈øt however confe≈øs that it does ≈øomething towards the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Bloud, and that is, by ≈øeparating the Choler from it, as ≈øhall be fullier ≈øhewn in the next Chapter. In it al≈øo is a pretty quantity of ≈øerous or wheyi≈øh humour filtrated or ≈øtrained from the Bloud, which is ≈øent by the Lympheducts to the common receptacle of the Chyle as afore≈øaid. In the third and la≈øt place it furthers the concoction of the Stomach by its kind and cheri≈øhing heat.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the <hi>Porus Bilarius,</hi> or Gall-pa≈ø≈øage.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Its branching in the Liver, and its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Choler how ≈øeparated from the Bloud, and its u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is difficult to give a ≈øatisfactory account why mo≈øt Creatures ≈øhould have both a <hi>Gall-bladder,</hi> for the collection of the Choler, and be≈øides, a <hi>Gall-pa≈ø≈øage;</hi> and yet a Hor≈øe and all whole-hoofed Bea≈øts, as al≈øo Harts, Fallow-deer and ≈øome few others, ≈øhould onely have the <hi>pa≈ø≈øage</hi> without the <hi>Bladder.</hi> It would be worth the while for our <hi>Virtuo≈øi</hi> to invent a probable rea≈øon of it, but for my own part I dare not pretend to be ≈øo ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious. But much have tho≈øe been mi≈øtaken that not finding any Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gall, have affirmed that an Hor≈øe hath no gall at all. And this, Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> reckons up among≈øt <hi>vulgar Errors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the trunk of this <hi>Gall-pa≈ø≈øage</hi> enters the Liver very near the ≈øame place with the <hi>Porta,</hi> together with which it is enwrapped in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cover, which they both borrow from that skin wherewith the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is cloathed. I mean they begin to be ≈øo inve≈øted ju≈øt at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Liver, for before they have but each one ≈øingle Coat. Its branches run along with tho≈øe of the <hi>Porta</hi> through all parts of the Liver, and it has the ≈øame Artery and Nerve running through its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. All the≈øe branches uniting into one trunk, it pa≈ø≈øes the directe≈øt way to the ≈ømall Gut, into which it is in≈øerted about a foot from the lower Orifice of the Stomach, where it di≈øcharges it ≈øelf of the Choler.</p>
                        <p>Having de≈øcribed the Ve≈ø≈øel, there remain two things to be enquired into, <hi>fir≈øt</hi> how the Choler is ≈øeparated in the Liver, and <hi>≈øecondly</hi> of what u≈øe it is. As to the fir≈øt, we mu≈øt con≈øider that there can be no ≈øuch ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, without ≈øome ≈øort of ferment to cau≈øe it. There comes indeed nothing to the Liver but under the form of bloud, but however it will be of u≈øe to examine from what parts that bloud comes: And among≈øt the re≈øt we find that a con≈øiderable quantity comes from the Spleen by the ≈øplenick branch. Now every one that will ta≈øte it may di≈øcern that the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57416:29"/>bloud that comes out of the Spleen by this branch has a kind of a ≈øowri≈øh har≈øh ta≈øte to what the re≈øt of the ma≈øs of bloud has. This then mixing with the re≈øt of the bloud and pa≈ø≈øing with it through the narrow Ve≈ø≈øels in the Liver, cau≈øes it there to ferment (as a ≈ømall piece of ≈øowr Dough will I know not how much that is not leavened) and in that fermentation this yellow Choler is ≈øeparated from the Bloud, much in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Ye≈øt from Beer in a Barrel, (which it partly re≈øembles in colour.) And this fermentation is a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the proper nature and faculty of the Liver given by Nature to it; who hath al≈øo framed this liquor of Particles ≈øo differing from tho≈øe of the Bloud, that though the Bloud pa≈øs out of the <hi>Porta</hi> into the <hi>Cava,</hi> yet the Choler ≈øtays behind and is received by the ≈ømall mouths of the Choler-pa≈ø≈øage. Some affirm this ≈øeparation is performed by the help of ≈øome Glands or little Kernels into which the ends of the ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels are in≈øerted, but I have not been able to di≈øcern them. The u≈øe of the Gall is, Together with the Juice that is ≈øent from the Sweet-bread, to make a ferment in the fir≈øt Gut for the u≈øes that are fully enough delivered in the eleventh Chapter: to which we ≈øhall onely add, that it ≈øerves by its acrimony to ex≈øtimulate the Guts to expell the Excrements contained in them. And ≈øeeing there is no bag or repo≈øitory to ≈øtore it up in, it pa≈ø≈øes continually to the Guts, whereby Hor≈øes come to dung of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than mo≈øt other Creatures: which as Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> notes, <q>was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrived by Providence in this Animal, con≈øidering his plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull feeding, the largene≈øs of his Guts, and their various circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, ≈øays he, Choler is the natural Gly≈øter, or one excretion whereby Nature excludes another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Spleen</hi> or <hi>Milt</hi> is of a ≈øoft, ≈øpongious <hi>≈øub≈øtance,</hi> like thick, black and congealed Bloud, from which it is ≈øaid to be generated; though ≈øome that of late have examined it more curiou≈øly with Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Gla≈ø≈øes, declare the greate≈øt part of its ≈øub≈øtance, be≈øides the Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈ø≈øels, to con≈øi≈øt of abundance of little Kernels inclo≈øed in skinny Cells like Honey-combs, which in their own nature are of a white colour, and will appear ≈øuch when the Bloud is wa≈øht from them. For my own part, I que≈øtion whether there be any ≈øuch Kernels in it, or if there be, they mu≈øt be far different from tho≈øe of any other part, and be of a much loo≈øer ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øeeing I have onely in River-water (after I had taken off the inve≈øting skin) wa≈øht off the parenchyma ≈øo clearly from the Ve≈ø≈øels, that there has ≈øeem'd to be nothing el≈øe remaining. A figure of which Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øo cleared of the parenchyma by wa≈øhing, you have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Table.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>≈øituation</hi> is under the ≈øhort Ribs on the left ≈øide over again≈øt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, between the Stomach and the ≈øhort or ba≈øtard Ribs. It <hi>cleaveth</hi> oft-times to the Midriff by a skin or coat, which it hath from the Rim of the Belly. It is al≈øo fa≈øtned by a skin to the Stomach.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57416:29"/>
                        <p>It is of a triangular <hi>≈øhape,</hi> yet long, and ≈øomething ≈øharp-pointed, as you may ≈øee in the Figure.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Colour</hi> is (in a ≈øound Hor≈øe) reddi≈øh, inclining ≈øomewhat to black; but in an un≈øound Hor≈øe it is more inclining to black, or of a leaden or a≈øhey colour: yet mo≈øt times in an un≈øound Hor≈øe it is of the colour of the Humour which offends.</p>
                        <p>There are ≈øeveral Creatures that naturally have no Spleen, as all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øects; and therefore that Proverb is not literally true, <hi>That even a Fly has a Spleen;</hi> Such al≈øo as have no Pi≈øs-bladder, want the Milt, as the <hi>Chameleon,</hi> and many ≈øuch like: But now it is a great que≈øtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuch Creatures as by Nature have Spleens, can have them taken out, and yet live. It is true indeed that other Parts that ≈øeem to be as con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, have been taken even out of <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies, and yet the Parties have lived: So I have read of ≈øome Women that upon incurable di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the Part, have had their Womb cut out, and yet have liv'd in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable health afterwards (<hi>Barthol.</hi> Epi≈øt.) And it is a common thing to geld any ≈øort of Creature, though there be con≈øiderably large Ve≈ø≈øels that run to the Stones. But it is to be confe≈øs'd that the≈øe parts in≈øtanc'd in, ≈øeem to be wholly framed for the propagation of the ≈øeveral <hi>kinds</hi> of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, and not for the nece≈ø≈øary ≈øervice of the <hi>Individual</hi> that has them. And therefore when they are taken away, though the end for which they were created, to wit <hi>generation,</hi> be fru≈øtrated by the lo≈øs of them; yet may the Creature it ≈øelf that lo≈øes them, live well enough without them. But now as for the Spleen, it does not at all ≈øerve for procreation, but is of u≈øe onely to that Body that has it. (What its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is, we ≈øhall ≈øhew towards the latter end of this Chapter.) Yet ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have boa≈øted that they have taken it out of Dogs and Cats, and that they have lived in pretty good plight a con≈øiderable while after. The operation mu≈øt needs be ≈øomewhat difficult, ≈øeeing the Spleen is ≈øeated on the in≈øide of the ≈øhort Ribs, nearer the Back than the Brea≈øt: nor can I believe that a Hor≈øe could live any while if it were taken out of him; but lea≈øt of all could Man, in whom it is larger than in any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Bartholin</hi> affirms. For the Ve≈ø≈øels that are in≈øerted into it are ≈øo many and large, that it would ≈øeem impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øtanch the Bloud; be≈øides the nece≈ø≈øary u≈øe that it ≈øeems to be of to the Body, of which by and by.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>skin</hi> that it is covered with, is <hi>thicker</hi> than that of the Liver, both becau≈øe of the loo≈øe and ≈øoft ≈øub≈øtance of the Spleen that required a ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger covering to defend it; and al≈øo that it might the better ≈øu≈øtain the ≈øtrong beatings of its Arteries that are pretty large and many. This skin it has from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly, to which it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit, as al≈øo to the left Kidney and the Midriff, and on its in≈øide to the Caul. Some late Anatomi≈øts have affirmed it to be clad with two Coats, the outer that which we have mentioned, and the inner ari≈øing from the Ve≈ø≈øels that enter the Spleen.</p>
                        <p>All the <hi>Veins</hi> that it has, are from that branch of the <hi>Porta</hi> that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Splenick branch. For the <hi>Porta</hi> as ≈øoon as it comes out of the lower or hollow ≈øide of the Liver, ≈øends one notable Branch to the Spleen, which pa≈ø≈øing cro≈øs the Body from the right to the left ≈øide under the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Stomach, enters the Spleen and di≈øper≈øes it ≈øelf into innumerable Twigs all over it. A Twig of the ≈øplenick Artery opens into this Vein a little before it enters the Spleen: And from the lower end of the Spleen
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57416:30"/>there go two or three Ve≈ø≈øels to the Stomach, which are called <hi>Va≈øa brevia</hi> or ≈øhort Ve≈ø≈øels. The u≈øe of the ≈øplenick Vein is to bring from the Spleen all that arterial blood that is not ≈øpent on its nouri≈øhment; and be≈øides, that proper and peculiar juice that is made in the Spleen, of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Arteries</hi> are three or four times more in number than the Veins, and all of them ≈øpring from the left Coeliack branch that has the name of <hi>Splenick,</hi> from the Spleen, into which it is in≈øerted. Hereby it receives vital heat and nouri≈øhment, and matter out of which to make its proper juice. Before this Artery enter the Spleen, it ≈øends forth one twig that unites with and opens into the ≈øplenick Vein, as was noted before.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Nerves</hi> are but ≈ømall yet pretty numerous. They ≈øpring from a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenterick branch of the left Interco≈øtal Nerve, and are di≈øper≈øed principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the skin that covers it, though ≈øome few enter its ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                        <p>La≈øtly, it has ≈øeveral <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> or Water-pa≈ø≈øages, which creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all over its Coat, take their way along the Caul towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receptacle of the Chyle, into which they empty the liquor contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, as all tho≈øe that ari≈øe from the ≈øeveral parts of the lower Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do. What the≈øe Lympheducts are, and what that liquor is which they contain, I have ≈øhown above in the 12th Chapter, <hi>of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no part of the Body concerning who≈øe u≈øe there has been greater diver≈øity of opinion. <hi>Some</hi> have made it the receptacle of black Choler (or of thick dreggy Bloud) ≈øeparated in the Liver and brought hither by the ≈øplenick branch. <hi>Others</hi> that thought this too ignoble and ba≈øe an u≈øe for ≈øo con≈øiderable a part, e≈øteem'd it to be as it were a ≈øecond Liver: For as they believed that the thinner and more ≈øpirituous part of the Chyle pa≈ø≈øed to the Liver; ≈øo, that a thicker and more dreggy part went to the Spleen, of which was made a blacker and more earthy ≈øort of Bloud, partly for its own nouri≈øhment, and partly for the nouri≈øhment of the Stomach, Guts, Me≈øentery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In an≈øwer to the≈øe two opinions it will be ≈øufficient to ≈øay, That the fir≈øt is contrary to the circulation of the Bloud, nothing pa≈ø≈øing from the Liver to the Spleen, but contrarily from the Spleen to the Liver: and the latter, be≈øides that it is contrary to the ≈øaid circulation, is repugnant al≈øo to the true motion of the Chyle, none of which either pa≈ø≈øes to the Liver or Spleen, as we have more than once ≈øhown already. A <hi>third</hi> opinion is, That of the bloud that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries bring to it in great plenty, is made a certain acid or ≈øowr Juice, which is ≈øent by the <hi>va≈øa brevia</hi> or ≈øhort Veins to the Stomach, into which being di≈øcharged, it partly provokes appetite, and partly helps concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this Opinion has had a great many Abettors, whereas its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity may be demon≈øtrated by this, that if one open a Dog (or the like) alive, and tie the≈øe ≈øhort Veins with a thred, they will fill and ≈øwell betwixt the Stomach and Ligature, but will grow empty on that ≈øide toward the Spleen; which is a plain evidence that the Bloud or whatever other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that runs in the≈øe ≈øhort Veins, flows <hi>from</hi> the Stomach and not <hi>to</hi> it. However we will grant that the Spleen does indeed make ≈øuch a ≈øowr Juice, of part of the Arterial bloud that is imported into it by the ≈øple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Artery; but then it pa≈ø≈øes not from thence to the Stomach, but to the Liver by the ≈øplenick branch of the <hi>Porta:</hi> for if one tie the ≈øaid branch, as was ≈øaid above of the <hi>≈øhort veins,</hi> it will fill towards the Spleen and grow empty towards the Liver. And the u≈øe of this Juice ≈øeems to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57416:31"/>be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That mixing in the trunk of the <hi>Porta</hi> with all the Bloud that is received by the branches thereof out of the ≈øeveral parts of the Lower Belly, e≈øpecially from the Guts, it enters with it into the Liver, where it cau≈øes the Bloud to ferment, whereby the Choler is ≈øeparated from it, for the u≈øes mentioned in the foregoing Chapter, where we have treated more at large of this ≈øeparation.</p>
                        <p>Another <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Spleen is, by its warmth to cheri≈øh the left ≈øide of the Stomach, as the Liver does the right, to further the concoction thereof. And this it may be conceived to doe in a very con≈øiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for ≈øeeing it has ≈øo very many Arteries, it mu≈øt needs be very warm.</p>
                        <p>There are many more Opinions concerning the u≈øe of the Spleen than the≈øe I have mentioned: but as it would be <hi>tedious</hi> to recite them, ≈øo it would be but <hi>needle≈øs</hi> to refute them, the new Doctrines of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bloud and the motion of the Chyle being improveable to a general confutation of them.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Kidneys</hi> are otherwi≈øe called <hi>Reins</hi> from their Latine name <hi>Renes,</hi> which is derived from a Greek word which ≈øignifieth <hi>to flow,</hi> becau≈øe the watery or wheyi≈øh part of the Bloud doth continually flow through them, and maketh the Urine.</p>
                        <p>They are in <hi>number</hi> two, that when one is ≈øtopt with a ≈øtone or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or hurt by any accident, the Urine might be ≈øeparated in the other, or otherwi≈øe the Bea≈øt would die. They are <hi>≈øeated</hi> in the Loins behind the Stomach and Guts, the right under the Liver and the left under the Spleen, on each ≈øide of the hollow Vein and great Artery, oppo≈øite to one another. They re≈øt upon the Mu≈øcles of the Loins, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt the Membranes of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> which keeps them firm in their place. They are <hi>knit</hi> to the hollow Vein and great Artery by the Emulgent Ve≈ø≈øels, and to the Bladder by the Ureters which we ≈øhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe in the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>They are ≈øeldom like to one another in <hi>≈øhape;</hi> for the Right is in figure like a Heart, but ≈øomething flatter; whereas the left is like that of a Man, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ≈øhape of a Kidney-bean, as you may ≈øee them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented in the following Figure.</p>
                        <p>They are covered with two <hi>Membranes,</hi> an <hi>inner</hi> which is <hi>proper,</hi> and an <hi>outer</hi> which is <hi>common.</hi> The <hi>inner</hi> Skin ≈øeems to ≈øpring from the outer Coat of tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels that enter into them: this cleaves ≈øo clo≈øe to them, that it can hardly be ≈øeparated, being very thin, and having ≈ømall threds of Nerves running along it from a twig of the Interco≈øtal Nerve. The <hi>outer</hi> which is common, is borrowed from the Rim of the Belly, and is wrapped ≈øomewhat loo≈øely about the Kidney. This Skin is bedaubed with fat, and is therefore called the <hi>fatty Coat;</hi> and into it are in≈øerted an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57416:32"/>and Vein, which have al≈øo the title of <hi>fatty,</hi> and ≈øpring from the great Artery and hollow Vein.</p>
                        <p>As to their <hi>≈øub≈øtance,</hi> it has been always till of late held to be hard and compact fle≈øh; and indeed it handles pretty firm to the touch, and ≈øeems to be fle≈øhy to the bare eye. But ≈øeeing there is no ≈øeparation made of any thing from the Bloud in other Parts, but by the help of Glands or Kernels; (for ≈øo is the Slaver ≈øeparated in the Mouth, the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the Liver, bad Humours in the Guts upon taking a purge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I ≈øay, for that cau≈øe it is rea≈øonable to give credit to tho≈øe curious Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi≈øts that by their Magnifying Gla≈ø≈øes or Micro≈øcopes have di≈øcovered the ≈øub≈øtance of the Kidneys to be for the greate≈øt part made up of ≈øuch Glands, by means of which the Urine is ≈øeparated from the Bloud, in ≈øuch manner as we ≈øhall ≈øhew by and by.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins</hi> are called <hi>Emulgents,</hi> becau≈øe they do as it were <hi>milk out</hi> the Urine from the ma≈øs of Bloud. Each Kidney has for the mo≈øt part but one Artery and one Vein; yet ≈øometimes two or more of a ≈øort. But whether the Trunk be one or more, each as it enters the Kidneys is branched into ≈øeveral, and tho≈øe into more ≈øucce≈ø≈øively, till they become as ≈ømall as hairs. The Emulgent <hi>Arteries</hi> ≈øpring from the Trunk of the great Artery, and the <hi>Veins</hi> from the hollow Vein: Both the≈øe as they enter the Kidney, are deve≈øted of their outer Coat, which makes the proper Coat of the Kidneys, as was ob≈øerved above: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of that lo≈øs they are inve≈øted in one common Ca≈øe with the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Ureter, even as we ≈øhewed in the fifteenth Chapter that the branches of the Gall-pa≈ø≈øage in the Liver are included in one common Coat or Ca≈øe with tho≈øe of the <hi>Porta.</hi> The Arteries bring bloud for their nouri≈øhment, and moreover the watery humour that is ≈øeparated in them and makes the Urine. By the Veins the bloud circulates back again to the hollow Vein or <hi>Cava,</hi> and by it a≈øcends up to the Heart.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the innumerable little Kernels which we have ≈øhewn the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the Kidney to con≈øi≈øt of, there are about ten of a more con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bigne≈øs in the middle or centre of it, placed at the entrance into the <hi>pelvis</hi> or Ba≈øon, which are in Latin called <hi>Carunculae Papillares,</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh Papillary Caruncles, and by ≈øome they are called Teat-like Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both which names they have from the likene≈øs they have to the Teats or Nipples of Women. They are ≈øomething harder than the re≈øt of the ≈øub≈øtance of the Kidney, and al≈øo of a fainter colour. They are in bigne≈øs as large as a ≈ømall Hor≈øe-bean. They have each ≈øeveral ≈ømall holes or pores, through which the Urine de≈øtills out of the ≈ølender Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pipes in the body of the Kidneys, into the cavity of the <hi>pelvis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>pelvis</hi> or Ba≈øon is a membranous cell or cavity in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Kidney, and is nothing el≈øe but the head of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>reter</hi> widened. There run out of it ≈øeveral large pipes to the afore≈øaid Teat-like Kernels, (one pipe to each Kernel) by which the Urine drils into this cavity, and out of it into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>reter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>action</hi> of the Kidneys, is to ≈øeparate the wheyi≈øh Humour from the Bloud, which they do in this manner and order. We find that an Hor≈øe can no more live without drink than meat: Now the drink ≈øerves not onely to cool the Body, but much more is it of u≈øe to make the Chyle thin, that it may be able to pa≈øs through the narrow ways of the milky Veins; ≈øo that the water which the Hor≈øe drinks, pa≈ø≈øes along with the more oily Chyle into the ma≈øs of Bloud, whither having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57416:33"/>it, the water is now of no more u≈øe, and therefore the Emulgent Arteries above-de≈øcribed conveigh it to the Kidneys together with the Bloud, to ca≈øt it out: But the Bloud, being of a thicker body than the water, cannot enter through tho≈øe narrow pa≈ø≈øages which the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtils through, and therefore what is more than ≈øerves for their nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, returns back from the Kidneys by the Emulgent Veins into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and ≈øo returns to the Heart again in its circulation. But the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or wheyi≈øh part running out of the larger into the ≈ømaller branches of the Emulgent Arteries ≈øucce≈ø≈øively, and the ≈øaid branches ≈øo often divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them≈øelves till at la≈øt they become as ≈ømall as an hair and end in the little Kernels towards the out≈øide of the Kidneys, this watery Humour is milked as it were through the≈øe Kernels into ≈ømall urinary pipes, as ≈ølender almo≈øt as Fibres, by which it drills along to the Papillary Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and is again ≈øtrained through them into the Ba≈øon, from whence it glides down the Ureters into the Bladder, where when it becomes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble≈øome either by its quantity or ≈øharpne≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it provokes the Hor≈øe to ≈øtale, and is called Urine. But ≈øeeing the Pi≈øs is not of the ≈øame colour with the water that was drunk, but generally a great deal yellower, it is likely it gains that colour from a little quantity of Choler mixed with it: And as the Choler <hi>either</hi> retains it natural colour, to wit yellow, <hi>or</hi> is preternaturally of ≈øome other, as black, greeni≈øh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Urine will be tinctured accordingly; as any Man may ob≈øerve in Hor≈øes that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempered. So that in Hor≈øes as well as in Men, one may many times gain ≈øome knowledge of the Di≈øtemper from the Urine.</p>
                        <p>Over the Kidneys a little more outward, and about an inch from them, there ≈øtand two Kernels, which are known by ≈øeveral <hi>Names,</hi> from the ≈øeveral u≈øes that Authors have a≈øcribed to them. Some call them Deputy-kidneys, becau≈øe of ≈øome re≈øemblance they have to the true ones in their frame, and becau≈øe they have been thought to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Urine. <hi>Bartholine</hi> calls them Black-choler Ca≈øes, from an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they receive black Choler from the Spleen. Others have impos'd other Names on them, which we ≈øhall not recite. It is not long ≈øince they were fir≈øt found out. They are in an Hor≈øe about as <hi>big</hi> as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-bean, and of that <hi>≈øhape</hi> as they are repre≈øented in the Figure. They are covered with a ≈øingle thin skin, which commonly ≈øticks to the fatty skin that inve≈øts the Kidneys. They have a ≈ømall cavity in them.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> generally come from the <hi>Emulgents,</hi> but ≈øometimes immediately from the great Artery and hollow Vein. The Arteries bring them bloud for nouri≈øhment, from which what remains, returns back by the Veins, as al≈øo does that Humour whatever it be that is concocted and ≈øeparated in them, for there is no other ve≈ø≈øel to do it. They have indeed ≈øome <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> but tho≈øe are common to <hi>them</hi> with <hi>other</hi> parts, and have no peculiar u≈øe here. Their <hi>Nerves</hi> ≈øpring from that branch of the Interco≈øtal pair that goes to the Stomach, to the Spleen, and to the inner or proper skin that cloaths the Kidneys.</p>
                        <p>In their Cavity there is commonly found a blacki≈øh Humour, which is made of part of the Arterial bloud that flows to them; but of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or u≈øe this Humour ≈øhould be, is very uncertain. It has no way to go out of the Cavity but by the Veins, which depo≈øite what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them into the Emulgent Veins, or into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and ≈øo it mu≈øt needs pa≈øs with the Venal bloud to the Heart. If there could be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57416:33"/>found out any way whereby it could probably pa≈øs to the Kidneys, then <hi>Bartholine</hi>'s Opinion, that they make a ferment for the u≈øe of the Reins, for the better ≈øeparating of the wheyi≈øh Humour from the Bloud, were very plau≈øible; but till then, one mu≈øt ≈øu≈øpend their belief of it. As for mine own part, ≈øeeing ≈øo many learned Anatomi≈øts as have treated of them, are at a lo≈øs in di≈øcovering their true u≈øe, I will not be a≈øhamed to confe≈øs my own ignorance and un≈øatisfiedne≈øs therein al≈øo.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The ≈øituation and ≈øub≈øtance of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Its Figure. Membranes. Its perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Its parts and connexion. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Bladder of Urine is ≈øeated at the bottom of the Belly, in that hollowne≈øs that is formed of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> Hips and the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> between the Coats of the Rim of the Belly; and is of a <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> partly membranous, for ≈øtrength, exten≈øion and contraction; and partly fle≈øhy, for motion; for by its fle≈øhy Fibres are its Membranes contracted: and the≈øe fle≈øhy Fibres are wholly ≈øeated in its middle Coat, which is truly mu≈øcular, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed by and by.</p>
                        <p>It is of a round globous <hi>figure,</hi> in ≈øhape like a Pear, having within it a large cavity or hollowne≈øs, wherein to contain the Urine.</p>
                        <p>It is compo≈øed of a treble <hi>Coat</hi> or Skin. The fir≈øt and <hi>outwardmo≈øt</hi> of which it hath derived to it from the Rim of the Belly, which Skin is very ≈øtrong and clo≈øe. The <hi>innermo≈øt</hi> is thin, white and bright, of an exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe, and is interwoven with all ≈øorts of Fibres, that it may the better bear inlarging and drawing up together, as need requireth. Within I have often found it covered with a mucous cru≈øt, which I take to be an Excrement of the third concoction of the Bladder, and to ≈øerve to defend it from being too much grated upon by the acrimony of the Urine. The <hi>middle</hi> betwixt the≈øe two, is as thick or thicker than them both, and is ≈øtuff with fle≈øhy Fibres, even as the ≈øame Coat of the Stomach and Womb are. Its Fibres run lengthways of the Bladder, and by contracting of them≈øelves ≈øqueeze out the Urine, forcing open the ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle that encompa≈ø≈øeth the neck of the Bladder.</p>
                        <p>It hath three <hi>perforations</hi> or holes, two on the hinder part a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the neck to let in the Urine from the Ureters, and one in the neck to let the Urine out.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>parts</hi> of the Bladder are two, its bottom and its neck. The bottom is its wider, more capacious part, and its neck, its narrower and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. The bottom is fa≈øt tied by a Membrane to the <hi>Inte≈øtinum rectum</hi> or Ar≈øe-gut, and to the <hi>Aorta</hi> (a little before its divi≈øion) by the Umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Arteries, ≈øo that no violent motion can cau≈øe it to fall down upon its neck, which if it ≈øhould happen, would hinder the outgate of the Urine. The neck is narrower but longer in Hor≈øes than in Mares, and in both it is fle≈øhy, being incompa≈ø≈øed with a ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle, which is woven with very many Fibres, ≈øome of which are ≈øtreight, and ≈øome overthwart, the≈øe la≈øt lying under the former. Now this ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle ≈øeems to be nothing el≈øe but the middle Coat of the Bladder made thicker here than in any other part, by the acce≈ø≈øion of the circular or overthwart Fibres. And its u≈øe is to pur≈øe up the neck of the Bladder ≈øo, as no Urine can pa≈øs out, till by its quantity or ≈øharpne≈øs it becomes ≈øo trouble≈øome to the Bea≈øt, as provokes him to force open the Sphincter by contracting the Mu≈øcles of the Paunch, and the mu≈øcular Coat of the Bladder. If this Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter happen to be overcooled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Hor≈øe lo≈øeth its u≈øe, and ≈øo for want of it his Water drops from him as fa≈øt as it comes into the Bladder.</p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57416:34"/>
                        <p>Its <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> proceed from the hypoga≈øtrick branches of the hollow Vein and great Artery, and are implanted into its neck, on which, part of them is ≈øpent, and the remainder runs through the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Its Nerves come partly from the Interco≈øtals and partly from the Marrow of that Bone of the Back that is called <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> that is next to the Crupper.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the Bladder is to receive the Urine from the Kidneys by the Ureters, and to contain it, like a Chamber-pot, till it is ≈øo full as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come trouble≈øome and unea≈øy to the Bea≈øt; for as ≈øoon as it becomes ≈øo, by the help of the Mu≈øcles of the Belly and the middle mu≈øcular Coat of the Bladder it is pre≈ø≈øed out of it by pi≈ø≈øing.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>BEcau≈øe the <hi>Yard</hi> of ≈øton'd Hor≈øes be≈øides its principal u≈øe which is to copulate with the Mare, has al≈øo an inferiour u≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> to di≈øcharge the Urine out of the Bladder; and becau≈øe this latter is the ≈øole u≈øe of it in Geldings, we will here treat of it next to the Bladder, in re≈øpect to the office it performs to <hi>it,</hi> and not defer it, as many Anatomi≈øts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies do, till we have di≈øcour≈øed of the parts that prepare, make and retain the Seed, to which it al≈øo mini≈øters.</p>
                        <p>The Yard of an Hor≈øe lies hid for the mo≈øt part within the Sheath, from which, when it is drawn, it borrows its covering, con≈øi≈øting of the Scarf-skin and true Skin, and the carnous Membrane, which are common to it with other parts of the Body: Its <hi>Glans</hi> has a proper Membrane that inve≈øts it, as the <hi>Glans</hi> of a Man's Yard has; and the whole con≈øi≈øts of two Nervous bodies (which make up the greate≈øt part of its bulk) a Partition-skin that goes betwixt them, the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra</hi> or Pi≈øs-pipe, the <hi>Glans,</hi> four Mu≈øcles and the Ve≈ø≈øels; of which in order.</p>
                        <p>The two <hi>Nervous bodies</hi> are encompa≈ø≈øed with a thick, firm and white skin, but their inner ≈øub≈øtance is very ≈øpongy and flaggy unle≈øs di≈øtended and filled with bloud and ≈øpirit, con≈øi≈øting for the greate≈øt part of nothing but Ve≈ø≈øels, to wit, Veins, Arteries and Nervous threads, which are wonderfully interwoven one with another. They ari≈øe from the lower part of the Share-bone at a ≈ømall di≈øtance one from the other, giving the Pi≈øs-pipe room to go betwixt them, but in a little while they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ≈øo are extended one by the ≈øide of the other the whole length of the Yard to the <hi>Glans,</hi> onely a thin skin coming betwixt them. At their ri≈øe they re≈øemble the letter Y.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pi≈øs-pipe</hi> is ≈øeated betwixt the≈øe, or rather below them, and is of a ≈øub≈øtance much like them. On its in≈øide it is membranous and very ≈øen≈øible. It is continued from the neck of the Bladder, and is much of an equal width through its whole length. At its beginning where it is joined to the neck of the Bladder it has a membranous valve, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Urine to come out, but hinders the Seed or any thing ≈øquirted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57416:35"/>into the Pi≈øs-pipe to go in, unle≈øs it be forced open with a Probe or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, or the like.</p>
                        <p>Before the ends of the Nervous bodies there is prefixed the <hi>Glans,</hi> which is di≈øtingui≈øhable from the re≈øt of the Yard by a round circle like a Crown going between them. This is of a more exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe than the Nervous bodies, but of not much an unlike ≈øub≈øtance, though ≈øome ≈øay it is glandulous. When the Yard is drawn, it has no other covering, but one proper thin coat.</p>
                        <p>The Yard has two <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> on each ≈øide at its root: The fir≈øt pair are ≈øhort and thick, ≈øpringing from the knob of the Hip-bone, and are in≈øerted into the Nervous bodies near their beginning: they are called <hi>Erectors,</hi> becau≈øe they help the Yard to ≈øtand. The ≈øecond are longer and ≈ømaller, ari≈øing from the ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle of the Ar≈øe-hole, and pa≈ø≈øing along the ≈øides of the Pi≈øs-pipe end about the middle of it, ≈øerving to open or widen it for the freer pa≈ø≈øage of the Seed and Urine, and are therefore called <hi>Dilaters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> ≈øpring from the Hypoga≈øtricks, and enter it at the meeting of the Nervous bodies. Its <hi>Nerves</hi> come from the lowe≈øt Vertebral.</p>
                        <p>The principal and primary u≈øe of the Yard is for copulation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Seed into the Womb of the Female: but the ≈øecondary, and to ≈øuch Creatures as are gelt, the onely u≈øe of it, is to ≈øerve as a Tap to the Bladder, to let out the Urine when it becomes trouble≈øome; in which office the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra</hi> or Pi≈øs-pipe is chiefly concerned.</p>
                        <p>Except when the Yard is di≈øtended with bloud and Spirits, (which is called its erection or ≈øtanding) it lies hid in its Repo≈øitory, the <hi>Sheath,</hi> of which little need to be ≈øaid, ≈øeeing it is onely a duplicature of the common coverings of the Body, and con≈øi≈øts onely of the ≈øcarf and true Skin, and the fle≈øhy Membrane, which is here but thin. It ≈øeems to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the prepuce or Fore-skin in Men: for as that in ≈øome Men, when the Yard is erect, turns back towards the root of the <hi>Penis</hi> and leaves the <hi>Glans</hi> wholly bare; ≈øo when a Hor≈øe's Yard is drawn out to the full length, the Sheath is al≈øo drawn out or unfolded, and appears to be knit to the Yard a little behind the <hi>Glans,</hi> even as the prepuce is to a Man's <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> at the ≈øame place. I ≈øhall not need therefore to ≈øpeak any more of it.</p>

                        <p>HAVING ≈øhewed the Parts appointed for and ≈øub≈øervient to Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and in ≈øome mea≈øure to <hi>Nutrition</hi> and Sanguification, I come in the next place to ≈øpeak to tho≈øe ≈øerving for <hi>Generation.</hi> And as the former, all except the Yard treated of in the la≈øt Chapter, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to and alike in both Male and Female; ≈øo the≈øe latter differing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderably in the different Sexes, we mu≈øt treat of them apart: and ≈øhall begin with the Generative Parts of an <hi>Hor≈øe,</hi> and afterwards treat of tho≈øe of a <hi>Mare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt in order are the <hi>preparing</hi> or <hi>≈øpermatick</hi> Ve≈ø≈øels, <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins.</hi> The Arteries carry bloud and vital ≈øpirit to the Stones to make Seed of, and the Veins bring back from thence ≈øo much of the bloud as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ≈øuperfluous or unfit for that purpo≈øe. The Arteries ≈øpring out of the de≈øcending Trunk of the great Artery, almo≈øt two hands breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Emulgents, one on each ≈øide: and the Veins out of the like Trunk of the hollow Vein, two on each ≈øide, a pretty deal higher up than the Arteries, as you may ob≈øerve in the foregoing Figure. The le≈øt of the≈øe Veins in Humane Bodies commonly ≈øprings from the left Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vein, (and is but one) the rea≈øon whereof Anatomi≈øts give to be, le≈øt, if it ≈øhould have ≈øprung from the <hi>Cava,</hi> and thereby been nece≈ø≈øita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have marched over the great Artery, the return of the bloud from the Stones by it ≈øhould have been hindred by the continual beating of the Artery. But ≈øeeing Nature has not here made the like caution, where there was as great need of it, I cannot tell whether that be any ≈øatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rea≈øon. Now the≈øe Arteries and Veins do at a little di≈øtance from their beginning meet with one another on their re≈øpective ≈øides, to wit the right Artery with the right Veins, and the left with the left, and at their meeting they acquire one common covering from the Rim of the belly, between who≈øe two Membranes they de≈øcend down the Loins,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57416:37"/>running over the Ureters, as the figure ≈øhews. As they de≈øcend, they be≈øtow little twigs upon the Rim of the Belly, and the Veins do divide them≈øelves into ≈øeveral, and by and by unite again; but the Arteries pa≈øs along a great way by one Pipe onely, though variou≈øly twi≈øted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the Veins, with which yet they do no where ino≈øculate, or unite into one body, as was generally affirmed they did before the circulation of the bloud was found out. For till then it was believed, that the Veins carried bloud to the Stones, and the Arteries vital Spirits, and that the Arteries opened into the Veins, and contrarily the Veins into the Arteries, for the mixing the bloud and vital ≈øpirits together, and thereby preparing matter for the Stones to make Seed of. But ≈øince the circulation of the bloud was fully under≈øtood, and it became certain that bloud and ≈øpirit flowed to the Stones by the Arteries onely; upon a ≈øtrict enquiry after the≈øe ino≈øculations, they were no where to be found, nor is there any thing like them, ≈øaving that both Veins and Arteries pa≈øs along in one common Cover, which it is likely gave occa≈øion to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtake. When the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels are arrived within little le≈øs than a quarter of a yard of the Stones, the Arteries then begin to branch them≈øelves into ≈øeveral, but the Veins into far more. And both of them pa≈øs out of the Belly by the hole of the proce≈øs of the Rim into the Cod. The ≈øpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt where the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels begin ≈øo much to divide them≈øelves, and the Stones, is called the <hi>Pyramidal body,</hi> becau≈øe from the Stones upwards, it grows ≈ømaller and ≈ømaller like a Pyramid, as is repre≈øented in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. It is al≈øo called <hi>Corpus varico≈øum,</hi> becau≈øe the Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øo divided make a thicker body; and la≈øtly <hi>plexus pampiniformis,</hi> the tendril-like <hi>plexus</hi> or interweaving, becau≈øe the Veins and Arteries twine and cla≈øp about one another like the tendrils of Vines. Both of the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Stones by ≈øeveral branches, but the Veins by a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the Arteries, which was nece≈ø≈øary, for that the bloud flows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick to the Stones by the Arteries, but returns but ≈ølowly back again by the Veins, and therefore it was convenient it ≈øhould have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts or chanels to run in.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe <hi>Preparing Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> may be ≈øufficiently learned by what we have already di≈øcour≈øed of them, by which it is al≈øo clear that the name of <hi>Preparers</hi> belongs onely properly to the Arteries that carry bloud and ≈øpirits to the Stones to nouri≈øh them and to make Seed of, and not at all to the Veins, which onely bring back that bloud that is not converted to tho≈øe u≈øes.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Lympheducts</hi> that run with the afore≈øaid Ve≈ø≈øels to the Te≈øticles, becau≈øe the Te≈øticles are the parts for which they are de≈øigned, and they are onely in their pa≈ø≈øage thither while they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the≈øe Veins and Arteries, we ≈øhall ≈øay nothing further of them here, but ≈øhall ≈øhew their origine and u≈øe in the following Chapter.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Their name. Their ≈øhape and ≈øub≈øtance. Their Ve≈ø≈øels. Their Coats. Their Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Para≈øtatae. The u≈øe of the Stones and Para≈øtatae.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Te≈øticles or Stones are called in Latin <hi>Te≈øtes,</hi> which otherwi≈øe ≈øignifies Witne≈ø≈øes, becau≈øe they witne≈øs the ≈øtrength and courage of the Creature; or perhaps rather, as ≈øome think, becau≈øe no Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the Romans was admitted to be a Witne≈øs that had lo≈øt his Stones. They are always according to Nature two, and therefore the Greeks call them by a word that ≈øignifies <hi>Twins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are of an oval <hi>figure,</hi> but ≈øomewhat flatti≈øh: and their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> has been formerly held to be glandulous, as if they were onely two great Kernels, not differing from other Kernels in other parts of the Body ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in bigne≈øs and u≈øe. But later Anatomi≈øts have di≈øcovered them to be of no ≈øuch ≈øolid ≈øub≈øtance as Glands are, but wholly to con≈øi≈øt of Ve≈ø≈øels that twi≈øt and twine this way and that way, and are kept in their order clo≈øe to one another by the inmo≈øt Skin that cloaths the Stones. When they are cut in two, they appear not red, but of that colour the Seed is of, becau≈øe the bloud as ≈øoon as it enters them, begins to lo≈øe its colour and nature, and to be turned into Seed. And ≈øeeing I could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve any bloud in the Stones, it is likely that the Veins reach no further than their Coats, ≈øeeing the Seed is not received into the Veins, but into peculiar Ve≈ø≈øels called <hi>Deferent</hi> or back-carrying, of which in the next Chapter. I ≈øay, I believe the Veins onely run through the Coats of the Stones, and have the ≈øuperfluous bloud tran≈ømitted into them from the Arteries, before ever they enter into the body of the Stones: And then tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels that the Te≈øticles con≈øi≈øt of, will onely be Arteries, run out into very fine and almo≈øt innumerable threads, for the elaborating of the Seed.</p>
                        <p>If this notion of mine be true, then I may ≈øay that both <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> run through all the Coats wherewith the Te≈øticles are inve≈øted, but that they them≈øelves have no Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels but Arteries. And whether they have any other ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øel, is uncertain. 'Tis true there are both <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Lympheducts</hi> that come towards the Stones, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved in the foregoing Chapter; but I que≈øtion whether they reach any farther than their Coats any more than the Veins. As for the <hi>Nerves,</hi> they ≈øpring from a Vertebral pair according to ≈øome, from the Interco≈øtal ≈øay others, and a third ≈øort think from both. But be their original where it will, I think they are mo≈øtly if not altogether ≈øpent upon the ≈øu≈øpending Mu≈øcles by which the Te≈øticles are ≈øu≈øtained, and upon the Coats ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned. So far am I from thinking with ≈øome, that the≈øe Nerves contribute the greate≈øt or any con≈øiderable ≈øhare of matter for the making of the Seed. The <hi>Lympheducts</hi> ≈øpring manife≈øtly from among≈øt the Coats of the Stones, and a≈øcend up into the Belly by the ≈øame hole, by which the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels came down, running ≈øo far till they reach and empty them≈øelves into the common Receptacle of the Chyle, de≈øcribed above <hi>chap.</hi> 10. and 12.</p>
                        <p>The Te≈øticles being ≈øen≈øible, tender and noble parts, are defended from the external cold or other Injuries by ≈øeveral <hi>Coats,</hi> of which ≈øome are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57416:38"/>common to them with other parts of the Body, and ≈øome proper to them≈øelves onely. The <hi>common</hi> incompa≈øs both the Stones within one cavity, as in a Bag, and make that which we call the Cod. And the≈øe are two. The outer of them is the Skin with its Scarf-skin, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the fle≈øhy Membrane. The outer is not divided as it is in Man, by a line that runs along the middle of it lengthways. The inner, as it ≈øticks pretty clo≈øe to this on one ≈øide; ≈øo to the next proper one ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what loo≈øely, by many membranous Fibres, on the other or inner ≈øide. The <hi>proper</hi> are al≈øo two, though by ≈øome they are reckoned to be three. The outmo≈øt is called <hi>Vaginalis,</hi> or the Sheath-like Coat, becau≈øe the Stone is included in it as in a Sheath. This is thick and ≈øtrong; ≈ømooth on the in≈øide, but rough on the out≈øide, by rea≈øon of many Fibres or Threads by which it is knit to the inner of the common Coats. It is full of Veins, and is a production of the Rim of the Belly: for as the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Ve≈ø≈øels de≈øcend over the Share-bone into the Cod, the Rim makes a Ca≈øe for them for their defence and ≈øecurity, and reaches with them down to the Stone, encompa≈ø≈øing <hi>it</hi> as well as <hi>them.</hi> Into this Coat is the Mu≈øcle in≈øerted that ≈øu≈øpends the Stone, (which we ≈øhall de≈øcribe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently.) Some make two Coats of this, the outmo≈øt of which retains the name of <hi>≈øheath-like</hi> above-mentioned; and the inner they call the <hi>red</hi> Coat, from its colour; but indeed this latter is nothing el≈øe but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid Mu≈øcle ≈øpreading it ≈øelf broad and thin on the Sheath-like Coat. The la≈øt and inmo≈øt, which immediately cloaths the Stone, (being the ≈øecond proper one) is called the <hi>nervous,</hi> and otherwi≈øe the <hi>white,</hi> Membrane, being thick and ≈øtrong, and of a whiti≈øh colour. It ≈øeems to ari≈øe from the outer Coat of the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels, and is rough on its in≈øide next the Stone, but ≈ømooth and ≈ølippery on its out≈øide.</p>
                        <p>Each Stone is ≈øu≈øpended or hangs by a Mu≈øcle called <hi>Crema≈øter,</hi> or the ≈øu≈øpender. The≈øe Mu≈øcles ari≈øe from the Ligament of the Share-bone, and de≈øcending by the proce≈øs of the Rim of the Belly (before ≈øpoken of) are in≈øerted into the Sheath-like Coat, which they ≈øtrengthen, the better to ≈øu≈øtain the weight of the Stones; and in the act of Copulation are ≈øaid to pull up the Stones, and thereby to ≈øhorten the ways the Seed has to pa≈øs.</p>
                        <p>On the top or back as it were of each Stone there lies a longi≈øh, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh and ≈øomewhat round body, di≈øtingui≈øhable very ea≈øily from them, though not of much an unlike ≈øub≈øtance; onely they are not ≈øo firm and compact as the Stones are. They are named <hi>Para≈øtatae</hi> or <hi>Attenders,</hi> becau≈øe they wait as it were on the Stones; and al≈øo <hi>Epididymidae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are placed <hi>upon the didymi</hi> or Twins, by which name the Stones are otherwi≈øe called. They con≈øi≈øt (as the Stones do) wholly of Ve≈ø≈øels running this way and that way, all which are united into one Thread or Chord, which is continued into the deferent Ve≈ø≈øel, of which in the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>From what has been already di≈øcour≈øed of the≈øe Parts, their <hi>u≈øe</hi> appears to be, to make and elaborate the Seed, for the propagation of the kind. Now the Matter out of which the Seed is made, ≈øeems to be onely the Arterial bloud, unle≈øs one ≈øhould admit ≈øome Animal ≈øpirits conveyed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Nerves and mixed therewith. But ≈øeeing any ino≈øculations of the Nerves with the Arteries is a thing not yet di≈øcovered either in the≈øe or any other parts, I incline to believe that the Nerves onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ≈øen≈øe to the≈øe parts, that the Animal may have the greater plea≈øure

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING done with tho≈øe Parts that prepare and elaborate the Seed, we come next to tho≈øe that are the Store-hou≈øes or Repo≈øitories of it, from whence it is ejected in Copulation. And of the≈øe the fir≈øt are the <hi>deferent</hi> or back-carrying ve≈ø≈øels, otherwi≈øe called <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> or ≈øquirting, becau≈øe in tho≈øe Animals that have no Seed-bladders to ≈øtore up the Seed in (≈øuch as Dogs and the like) it does immediately ≈øquirt through the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels from the Stones in Copulation: though in others that have Seed-bladders (as Hor≈øes have) it is continually a-pa≈ø≈øing by the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels from the Stones to the Bladders by little and little as it is prepared.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe <hi>deferent Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> are two, one on each ≈øide; they begin at the ≈ømaller end of the <hi>para≈øtatae</hi> (de≈øcribed in the former chapter) and are indeed but a continuation of them. They are whiti≈øh and pretty hard; not hollow like a Vein, but more like a Nerve, for their cavity is hardly di≈øcernable, unle≈øs the Seed-bladders be full of Seed, and ≈øo it regurgitate as it were into the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels, as I have ≈øometimes ob≈øerved. As ≈øoon as they are ari≈øen from the <hi>Para≈øtatae,</hi> they a≈øcend ≈øtreight out of the Cod into the Belly by the ≈øame proce≈øs of the Rim of the Belly by which the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels de≈øcended. Being entred the Belly, by and by they cro≈øs over the Ureters from the out≈øide to the in≈øide of them, and taking a little compa≈øs they turn back again under the Bladder till they arrive almo≈øt at its neck, (towards which they grow wider than before) and there their ≈øides open into the Seed-bladders, into which they de≈øtill the Seed; notwith≈øtanding them≈øelves ≈øtill keep on their cour≈øe as far as the Pi≈øs-pipe between the Pro≈øtates, but are grown much ≈ømaller before they reach them. The≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øerve as Conduit-pipes for the Seed to drill along from the Stones to the ≈øeminal Bladders; and through their necks, that reach from the Bladders to the Pi≈øs-pipe, does the Seed i≈ø≈øue in the act of generation.</p>
                        <p>The place where the Seed is ≈øtored up and pre≈øerved, is the <hi>Seed-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> affirms that in an Hor≈øe <q>they con≈øi≈øt of <hi>two</hi> parts, of which <hi>one</hi> is a mere membranous or skinny Bladder, the <hi>other</hi> glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous. The Bladder, he ≈øays, he has found ≈øix inches long and near three broad, although it was empty and not opened; but it ≈øeem'd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ≈øtretched out to a greater length and width, if it had been filled. If one opened the bottom of this Bladder, and put a Probe into it, the Probe pa≈ø≈øed obliquely towards the Pi≈øs-pipe, and entred into it through the ≈øame hole with the deferent Ve≈ø≈øel of the ≈øame ≈øide.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57416:39"/>The <hi>other</hi> part of the≈øe Bladders, which we called glandulous, was thicker, and broader on that ≈øide which joyned to the Pi≈øs-pipe; and where the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels were in≈øerted, without de≈øcending towards the bottom, it grew thinner and thinner like a wedge. The ≈øub≈øtance of this glandule was not much unlike to that of the Stones, but of a more clayie colour, and had holes within it ≈øo apparent that they would admit an indifferent Probe: all which holes were united into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duct, namely before they reach the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra.</hi> For putting a Probe into any one of the ≈øaid holes, it was driven ea≈øily and without any lett into that common pa≈ø≈øage. But the pa≈ø≈øage it ≈øelf did not quite pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Pi≈øs-pipe, but was covered with the thin and ≈øpongie Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra.</hi> Through this Membrane is the ≈øpermatick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øtrained in Copulation.</q> Thus far Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> in his 30. chap. <hi>of the Glands.</hi> Now as for my ≈øelf, I could never ob≈øerve ≈øo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of one part of the ≈øeminal Bladders from another, as that one ≈øhould appear membranous and the other glandulous. And I would not imagine that ≈øo skilfull an Anatomi≈øt ≈øhould mi≈øtake the Pro≈øtates for a part of the ≈øaid Bladders, though the≈øe are the onely Parts that to me appear glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thereabouts. All the Seed-bladders that I have ob≈øerved have been much of a like ≈øub≈øtance, though perhaps a little thicker in one place than another: they are whiti≈øh and very ≈øtrong, being within all full of little Cells like Pomegranates. They have no communication the one with the other; for as their bottoms or thicker ends bunch out a little on each ≈øide of the Bladder (as you ≈øee in the Figure) ≈øo their ≈ømaller ends or mouths, that are neare≈øt to one another, do each of them open apart into the deferent Ve≈ø≈øel of their re≈øpective ≈øide, by who≈øe neck they pour out their Seed in Copulation into the Pi≈øs-pipe. The Seed comes into them out of the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, and goes out of them again into the ≈øame Ve≈ø≈øels, at one and the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øage or orifice. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ≈øays, that the ≈øeminal Matter contained in them differs much from that which is made in the Stones: whence he concludes that the Seed-bladders receive not the <hi>matter</hi> which they contain, from the Te≈øticles by the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, but do elaborate it in their own glandulous ≈øub≈øtance; and he calls it <hi>Seed of a peculiar kind.</hi> For my own part I have not di≈øcovered any difference, to ≈øpeak of, betwixt this and that which I have ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øeen in the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, when the Bladders have been very full; nor is it probable they can be of a different kind or nature, ≈øeeing there is that manife≈øt communication between the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels and the Bladders, that the≈øe latter ≈øeem to contain or receive nothing, but what the former bring into them. Nor do I think that any Part does elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any Liquor that can with any propriety be called Seed, except the Te≈øticles contained in the Cod, who≈øe ≈øole office and prerogative it is to make it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe Bladders (as hath been ≈øaid) is to receive the Seed from the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, and to re≈øerve it untill the time of Copulation. Now the Seed may (to ≈øatisfy the curio≈øity of the Ingenious Anatomi≈øt) be plainly ≈øeen, if you take the Bladders in your hand and ≈øqueeze them with your finger; for by ≈øuch ≈øqueezing you ≈øhall force the ≈øeminal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Pipe of the Yard, where you may by di≈ø≈øecting the Yard or opening that Pipe plainly ≈øee it. Or if you think it too much to take that pains, you may by di≈ø≈øecting the Bladders them≈øelves ≈øee it; but then you lo≈øe the ≈øight of one of the curious contrivances of Nature,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57416:39"/>which is a little Caruncle or Kernel that is placed at the mouth of the hole where the Seed di≈øtills into the Yard, which Caruncle is by Nature placed there, to prevent the i≈ø≈øuing forth of the Seed when there was no need for it; for the continual gleeting of it, which would have happened but for this Caruncle, would be extremely prejudicial to the Creature. This Caruncle in Men being impaired or injured by the Venereal Di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or by their over≈øtraining them≈øelves in the act of Copulation, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by Phy≈øicians believed to be the cau≈øe of the running of the Reins. And this Di≈øea≈øe Hor≈øes are not exempted from, although it doth not happen to them on the like occa≈øions as to men it doth; for this Di≈øea≈øe, which in Hor≈øes we call the mattering of the Yard, happens to them upon their catching ≈øuddain colds after hard riding; Likewi≈øe over-hard riding it ≈øelf will bring it; and very often it is cau≈øed by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs occa≈øioned by great poverty and the like.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we come to the <hi>Pro≈øtates,</hi> which are ≈øo called from their <hi>≈øtanding before</hi> the Seed-bladders. They are Glandulous bodies, almo≈øt of the ≈øame nature and ≈øub≈øtance as other Glandules of the Body. They are ≈øituated at the root of the Yard above the ≈øphincter Mu≈øcle of the Bladder, being in number two, on each ≈øide of the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one; their quantity about the bigne≈øs of a ≈ømall Burgamy Pear. They are of an oval figure, onely ≈øomewhat flat, and are covered with a very thick Coat to hinder the oily ≈øub≈øtance with which they are well ≈øtored, from i≈ø≈øuing forth.</p>
                        <p>They have Veins, Arteries, Nerves and Lympheducts; and be≈øides, many Pores that open into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra.</hi> In mo≈øt Creatures, e≈øpecially the le≈ø≈øer ≈øort, the≈øe Pores are ≈øcarcely di≈øcernible in an healthfull ≈øtate, but in an Hor≈øe they are very plain, and open into the upper part of the Pi≈øs-pipe about an inch di≈øtance from the in≈øertion of the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels into the ≈øame. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> has told twelve ≈øuch little holes, before each of which as they open into the Pi≈øs-pipe, is placed a little Gland, about the bigne≈øs of a grain of Mu≈øtard-≈øeed, which ≈øerve to hinder the entrance of the Urine into the≈øe holes, as it runs by them out of the Bladder.</p>
                        <p>The nature and <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Liquor that is contained in the≈øe Pro≈øtates, and that i≈ø≈øues out of them into the Pi≈øs-pipe, is ≈øomewhat difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Some take them to be a kind of Te≈øticles, and think that they make a ≈øort of Seed, which though it be not of ≈øo noble a nature as that which is made in the Te≈øticles contained in the Cod, yet is as nece≈ø≈øary for generation: ≈øeeing ≈øuch Men as are cut for the Stone become incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of generation, if the Stone be ≈øo big and ragged as much to tear the Pro≈øtates in pulling of it out. But it is likely, ≈øuch barrenne≈øs happens not ≈øo much from the tearing of the≈øe, as that the ends of the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels are torn likewi≈øe, or it may be the Seed-bladders al≈øo: and ≈øo when the Wound is healed up again, the ≈øides of the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øo that they can neither contain nor convey into the Pi≈øs-pipe any Seed. It is probable therefore that this oily clammy Humour that the Pro≈øtates di≈øcharge into the Pi≈øs-pipe, is of a nature far different from that of Seed, even as them≈øelves are bodies of a far other nature than the Stones are. For, as was ≈øhewn above, the Stones are wholly va≈øcular, that is, con≈øi≈øt wholly of Ve≈ø≈øels; whereas the≈øe are glandulous, or ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly. So that I believe this Humour ≈øerves onely to make the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rethra</hi> ≈øupple and ≈ølippery, and to defend it from the acrimony or ≈øharpne≈øs of the Urine.</p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57416:40"/>
                        <p>And thus we have done with all the Parts that make or retain the Seed: as for the Yard, which ≈øome treat of in this place, becau≈øe it ≈øerves for injecting the Seed into the Womb; we de≈øcribed the Parts thereof above <hi>chap.</hi> 20. next to the Bladder, becau≈øe it ≈øerves as well for making water as for Copulation, and thither the Reader may plea≈øe to turn back.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Preparing Ve≈ø≈øels. 1. Arteries. 2. Veins. Their u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT was <hi>Galen</hi>'s opinion, and from his authority, of many others, that the Parts ≈øerving for generation in the Female differed not from tho≈øe of the Male ≈øaving in ≈øituation; the Male's Genitals being without the Body, and the Females within. And this diver≈øity of ≈øituation they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to defect of heat in the Female, ≈øo that the Genitals could not be thru≈øt out of the Body as in the Male they are. But the truth is, they differ not onely in ≈øituation, but in number, bigne≈øs, figure, office and u≈øe, as will be apparent as well from the de≈øcription of them, as from their repre≈øentation in the Figures.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt in order are the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels, Arteries and Veins. In the≈øe it was till of late believed that the bloud was prepared for the Stones the readilier to be turned by them into Seed. But as when we treated above of the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels of the Hor≈øe, we ≈øhewed that the Veins could not properly be called <hi>preparing</hi> Ve≈ø≈øels, becau≈øe they carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Stones, but bring bloud back again from them: ≈øo in Mares we cannot allow the name of <hi>preparers</hi> or <hi>≈øpermatick</hi> to be proper even to the Arteries them≈øelves, ≈øeeing neither Mares nor any other Females have any true Seed. For their Stones are but improperly ≈øo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more truly Ovaries or Egg-beds, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew by and by in the next Chapter. However we ≈øhall retain the old name for di≈øtinction's ≈øake, and ≈øtill call both Veins and Arteries <hi>preparing Ve≈ø≈øels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The preparing Arteries of the Hor≈øe we ≈øhewed to be onely two, one on each ≈øide; but in the Mare there are ≈øeveral, three or more on each ≈øide. All of them ari≈øe out of the great Artery, below the Emulgents, ≈øome higher, ≈øome lower. They pa≈øs down along with the Veins of their re≈øpective ≈øides, with which they are very much interwoven, but no where open one into the other. Some branches of them go to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticles, ≈øome to the Horns of the Womb, and ≈øome to its Sheath.</p>
                        <p>The preparing Veins in the Hor≈øe were two of each ≈øide, though the Arteries were but one; yet in the Mare where the Arteries are ≈øeveral, the Veins are but one of each ≈øide. The rea≈øon whereof ≈øeems to be, That the Arteries in the Mare being not ≈øo much intended for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment of her Genitals as of the Foal contained in her Womb, it was requi≈øite there ≈øhould be ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels for the bringing the greater plenty of <hi>nouri≈øhing juice</hi> for it; all or the greate≈øt part of which being received by the Foal, there was not need of the like number of Veins to carry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57416:40"/>back the bloud that came along with it, that being very incon≈øiderable for its quantity to what was imported by the Arteries. But now all the bloud brought by the preparing Arteries of the Hor≈øe, ≈øerving for no other u≈øe but for the nouri≈øhment of the Genitals, and for the making of Seed: <hi>As</hi> a le≈øs quantity of bloud will ≈øuffice for the≈øe two u≈øes, and ≈øo there is no need of a plurality of Arteries; <hi>≈øo</hi> the bloud that is brought to the Genitals, is but a very ≈ømall part of it ≈øpent in performing the≈øe two offices, and therefore more Veins were nece≈ø≈øary to carry the ≈øurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage back again, ≈øeeing the motion of the bloud in the Arteries is far quicker than of that in the Veins. The≈øe <hi>two</hi> preparing Veins then ari≈øe out of the <hi>Cava</hi> a little below the Emulgents, and neither of them from the Emulgent it ≈øelf, any more than in the Hor≈øe, though in Men and Women the Left generally ≈øprings from the left Emulgent. They join in like manner with the Arteries as we ≈øhewed above that they did in Hor≈øes, and go to all tho≈øe parts of the Genitals to which we ju≈øt now ≈øhewed that the Arteries run.</p>
                        <p>When the Mare is not with Foal, the Arteries bring onely bloud for the nouri≈øhment of the ≈øeveral Parts into which they are in≈øerted: but when ≈øhe is with Foal, they bring be≈øides the bloud a nutritious juice, (which is Chyle, impregnated with ≈øpirit, but not as yet perfectly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into bloud) for its growth and nouri≈øhment, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when we come to ≈øpeak how the Foal is nouri≈øhed in the Womb. And whether ≈øhe be with Foal or not, the Veins ≈øerve to carry back to the <hi>Cava</hi> and ≈øo to the Heart, the bloud that is ≈øuperfluous.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the Te≈øticles or Stones in Mares, otherwi≈øe called Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and of the Trumpets of the Womb.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Te≈øticles. Their ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Bigne≈øs, and figure. Coat. Sub≈øtance, and u≈øe. The Trumpets of the Womb. Their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and length. Their u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Te≈øticles</hi> in Mares do not agree in their de≈øcription with tho≈øe of Hor≈øes in any one particular thing, nor ≈øhould I call them by that name, if the general mi≈øtake of ≈øo many Ages (in thinking the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male's Stones to have the ≈øame office with tho≈øe of the Male) had not made it nece≈ø≈øary to retain that appellation, if I would be under≈øtood by vulgar Readers of what part I am treating. For it has been an old Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Male and Female's Seed being mixed in the Womb, doth make the Conception; and there are many that will not <hi>yet</hi> be beaten out of it. Whereas the Female hath no Seed at all, but their Te≈øticles (≈øo called) are as it were knots of Eggs, which being impregnated by the Male's Seed, one or more at a time, do each make a Conception. But of this more by and by.</p>
                        <p>The Mare's Te≈øticles differ from the Hor≈øe's in the≈øe Particulars.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt, The Hor≈øe's Stones hang without the Body in the Cod, but the Mare's lie within the cavity of the Belly, a little di≈øtance from the horns of the Womb, to which they are knit by a ≈øtrong Ligament.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57416:41"/>
                        <p>Secondly, The Mare's Te≈øticles are hardly half as big as the Hor≈øe's, nor are they of the ≈øame ≈øhape, but more flat and thin, having no <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtatae</hi> upon them. And be≈øides, they are ≈øomewhat uneven in their ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, whereas tho≈øe of an Hor≈øe are ≈ømooth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Hor≈øes Te≈øticles are covered with four Coats, two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and two proper; but the Mare's are clad onely with one for about one half of them, and the other half with two; the outer of which they have immediately from the preparing Ve≈ø≈øels that enter into them, but mediately from the Rim of the Belly.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly and la≈øtly, They differ very much from one another in their ≈øub≈øtance and u≈øe. For we ≈øhewed above in <hi>chap.</hi> 22. that the Hor≈øe's Stones did wholly con≈øi≈øt of Seed ve≈ø≈øels turn'd and roll'd this way and that way: but the Mare's con≈øi≈øt principally of numerous Membranes and ≈ømall Fibres loo≈øely united to one another; among≈øt which there are ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral little Bladders, about as big as a Pea≈øe, ≈øome bigger, ≈øome le≈øs, that are full of a very clear and thin liquor. Tho≈øe that were of opinion that the Females made Seed as well as the Males, thought that the≈øe Bladders that are chiefly in the ≈øurface of the Te≈øticle, an≈øwered to the Seed blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Male, and that the humour contained in them was true Seed. And whereas it might be objected that it is far more clear and watery than the Male's Seed, they thought it ≈øufficient to an≈øwer, that that was from the colder and moi≈øter nature of the Female, that could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it to that con≈øi≈øtency as the Male's is of. But the truth is, it is not Seed; and if it were, there is no way whereby it could po≈ø≈øibly arrive at the Womb. For that which was reputed to be the deferent Ve≈ø≈øel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be nothing el≈øe but a ≈øhort and broad Ligament for fixing the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticle in its place; for it has no cavity at all, but is of a ≈øolid, firm and clo≈øe ≈øub≈øtance. The≈øe Bladders therefore mu≈øt be concluded to be Eggs, an≈øwering to tho≈øe of Fowl and other Creatures: which will be the more manife≈øt if you boil them, for then, as tho≈øe that have tried it do affirm, they will have the ≈øame colour, ta≈øte and con≈øi≈øtency with the whites of Hens-eggs. Whence the≈øe Te≈øticles may more properly be called <hi>Ovaries</hi> or Egg-beds, who≈øe Eggs are nouri≈øhed by the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels de≈øcribed in the foregoing Chapter; and when upon Copulation one (or more) of them is made fruitfull by the Male's Seed, it ≈øeparates from the re≈øt, and being received by the mouth of the Trumpet of the Womb, it de≈øcends by it into the Horn, and ≈øo to the bottom of the Womb, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Conception. And whereas it has been thought a ≈øtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Female's having true Seed, and that the≈øe Te≈øticles made it, in that when they are cut out of the Body in Bitches, Hogs, or any other Creature, ≈øuch Creatures are always barren afterwards; this new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ≈øhews that there is no ≈øtrength or certainty at all in that argument. For granting, what is mo≈øt certainly true, that Females that are gelt or ≈øpay'd, have never any Young after; yet it does not at all follow, that therefore their Stones make and con≈øerve Seed; but onely that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øomething that is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary for generation and conception: but whether that be Seed or ≈øomewhat el≈øe, is indifferent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Argument will be as ≈øtrong for the Opinion that the Te≈øticles are <hi>Ovaries,</hi> ≈øeeing without the Eggs it is ≈øo far from po≈ø≈øible that there ≈øhould be a conception, that they are the very conception it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>Of the <hi>Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels</hi> that run through the Te≈øticles we treated in the foregoing Chapter under the name of Preparing Ve≈ø≈øels: As for their

                           <hi>Nerves,</hi> they ≈øpring from the Interco≈øtal pair, and from the Nerves of <hi>Os ≈øacrum. Bartholin</hi> affirms that they have al≈øo <hi>Lympheducts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There hath not been greater di≈øpute about the matter of the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than by what way any thing could go to the Womb or its Horns from the Te≈øticles to make it. Some have pretended to the di≈øcovery of Ve≈ø≈øels or Pipes for conveyance thereof, which others altogether as skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Anatomi≈øts could find no foot≈øteps of. At la≈øt <hi>Fallopius</hi> a≈ø≈øigned this office to two Ducts, which from their ≈øhape he called <hi>Tubae</hi> or Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and from him (as being the fir≈øt Inventer of them, or at lea≈øt the fir≈øt that a≈øcribed this u≈øe to them) they are commonly known by the name of the Fallopian Trumpets. He ≈øays, <q>they are nervous and white, ari≈øing from the Horns of the Womb, where they are very ≈ølender, but at a ≈ømall di≈øtance from it they grow wider, bending this way and that way, till near their end, where cea≈øing their winding they grow pretty large, and ≈øeem ≈øomewhat carnous.]</q> Their ends next the Te≈øticles are torn and jagged, and lie loo≈øe, being freed from the Membrane that ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtains them the greate≈øt part of their length.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> ≈øeems rather membranous than nervous, (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> would have it.) And they con≈øi≈øt of two <hi>Membranes;</hi> the <hi>inner</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from the inmo≈øt Tunicle of the Womb, and the <hi>outer</hi> from the outmo≈øt of the ≈øame. Where they are wide≈øt they will admit ones little finger, but towards the Horn of the Womb, they are not ≈øo thick as an ordinary ≈øtraw, but yet are pervious; and where they open into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide of the Horn, their Orifice looks like a little Teat. As to their length, it is ≈øomething difficult to determine it exactly, becau≈øe they run ≈øo to and again in their cour≈øe; but I believe they are very near a quarter of a yard long.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is, <hi>both</hi> to ≈øerve as two Funnels whereby ≈øome ≈øubtile particles or ≈øteams may i≈ø≈øue from the Seed, that is injected by the Male into the Womb, to the Te≈øticles of the Female for the fecundating or making fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the Eggs thereof, one or more, according to the different ≈øpecies of living Creatures; (but it is very rare, that there is above one ≈øo impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in a Mare, ≈øeeing it is ≈øo ≈øeldom that any brings forth twins:) <hi>and al≈øo</hi> when the Egg is fecundated by this means, and growing ripe as it were, drops off or ≈øeparates from the Te≈øticle, it is received by the jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mouth of the Trumpet, along which it pa≈ø≈øes till it arrive in the Horn of the Womb, into which (as was ≈øaid above) the Trumpet is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted; and on this con≈øideration the old name of <hi>deferent Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> may ≈øtill be granted them, from their conducting the Eggs from the Te≈øticle to the Womb. Now ≈øeeing the wide ends of the Trumpets that fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eggs lie loo≈øe, and are not fa≈øtened to the Te≈øticle, it is probable that in Copulation the≈øe become turgid as well as all the other parts of the Genital, and with their jagged mouths cla≈øp hold upon the <hi>Te≈øtes</hi> (as a Lamprey's mouth fa≈øtens upon a ≈øtone) and ≈øo convey to them a ≈øeminal air, and afterwards receive from them a fecundated Egg.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the Womb and its Horns.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The ≈øhape and parts of the Womb. Its ≈øituation. Ligaments. Sub≈øtance. Ve≈ø≈øels. 1. Arteries. 2. Veins. 3. Nerves. 4. Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts. Its Horns. Its u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Womb of a Mare is ≈øhaped much like the Greek Letter <hi>Y,</hi> in which the ≈øingle ≈øtroak that is ≈øtreight, an≈øwers to the <hi>vagina</hi> or Sheath, which receives the Hor≈øe's Yard in Copulation, and the two crooked ≈øtroaks that turn one the one way, and the other the other, are called <hi>Horns,</hi> becau≈øe they in ≈øome ≈øort re≈øemble them; and that part of the Sheath where the Horns begin to ≈øeparate, being ≈øomewhat wider than the re≈øt, is the <hi>fundus</hi> or bottom of the Womb, where the Foal lies. For though in Dogs, Rabbets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have many young ones at one time, their burthen is contained wholly in the Horns of the Womb, as well as the Conception is fir≈øt made there; yet in a Mare that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings forth but one at a time, it is otherwi≈øe; for there is little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that belongs to the Foal, contained in them, except ≈øome part of the Skins wherein the Foal is covered while it is in the Womb.</p>
                        <p>The Womb is ≈øeated in the lowe≈øt part of the Lower Belly, in that wide Cavity that is formed out of and invironed with the Hip-bones, the Share-bone, and the <hi>os ≈øacrum.</hi> It is placed betwixt the Pi≈øs-bladder and the Ar≈øe-gut, and is firmly tied in its place by two pair of <hi>Ligaments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt <hi>pair</hi> ari≈øe from the Rim of the Belly, being ≈øhorter by much than the other, but broader, being for their ≈øhape re≈øembled to Bat's wings. They are of a membranous, loo≈øe and ≈øoft ≈øub≈øtance, and are in≈øerted into the Horns of the Womb, taking hold al≈øo of the Te≈øticles, and tying them both fa≈øt to the Hip-bones, from whence they ≈øpring.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond <hi>pair</hi> of Ligaments ≈øpring from the bottom of the Womb, and are called the round or worm-like Ligaments. They a≈øcend on each ≈øide between the two Coats of the Rim of the Belly, towards the Share-bone, over which they pa≈øs ≈ølantingly, and then parting into many jags as it were, they end near the <hi>clitoris.</hi> This al≈øo ≈øerves to fa≈øten the Womb the more firmly in its place.</p>
                        <p>It is of a nervous or rather membranous ≈øub≈øtance, more compact and clo≈øe in Mares that are not with Foal, but more ≈øpongie in ≈øuch as are. It con≈øi≈øts of two Membranes, and a certain fle≈øhy or fibrous parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma or ≈øub≈øtance between, unle≈øs one will make this a third Membrane. The outmo≈øt Membrane is borrowed from the Rim of the Belly, and therefore is truly double as that is, though we reckon it but for one. This is very ≈øtrong. The inmo≈øt is not ≈øo ≈øtrong nor firm as it, but ≈øeems to be ≈øomewhat porous. The middle ≈øub≈øtance betwixt the≈øe two is that which makes up the greate≈øt part of its thickne≈øs at all times, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when the Mare is with Foal, it imbibes ≈øo much of the nutritious Juice that flows plentifully hither at that time, that it is ≈øtuft up to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt an inch thickne≈øs.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Arteries</hi> are branches partly of the Preparing Arteries and partly of the hypoga≈øtrick. The≈øe do ino≈øculate or communicate by open mouths one with another, but not ≈øo with the Veins. They run along the Womb bending and winding, and not in a ≈øtreight cour≈øe, le≈øt they ≈øhould be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57416:42"/>broken when the Womb is extended to that va≈øt bulk as it is when the Mare is with Foal.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Veins</hi> ≈øpring al≈øo from the preparing and hypoga≈øtrick Veins, but are much fewer in number than the Arteries. For Nature having formed the≈øe Parts not ≈øo much for the benefit of the Individual, as for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kind; and the Foal while it is in the Womb receiving no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment but what is brought to it by the Arteries, it was nece≈ø≈øary that they ≈øhould be large and numerous for conveying the greater plenty of it: but ≈øeeing the greate≈øt part of that which is brought by the Arteries is ≈øpent in the nouri≈øhment of the Young and the Parts in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, a fewer number of Veins are ≈øufficient to convey back again what is not ≈øo ≈øpent. The Veins do ino≈øculate with one another like as the Arteries did.</p>
                        <p>It has <hi>Nerves</hi> from the Interco≈øtal pair, and from the Nerves of <hi>os ≈øacrum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some have al≈øo ob≈øerved many <hi>Lympheducts</hi> creeping along its ≈øurface, which one after another meeting into one, empty them≈øelves into the common receptacle of the Chyle and <hi>Lympha;</hi> and the≈øe <hi>Lympheducts</hi> ≈øome have mi≈øtaken for Milky-veins.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of the <hi>Womb</hi> properly ≈øo called: and what we have ≈øaid hereof, may be all applied to its <hi>Horns</hi> likewi≈øe as to their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> and <hi>ve≈ø≈øels.</hi> As for their <hi>figure,</hi> you may view it in the following Cut. The≈øe Horns are le≈øs in Mares than in any other Creature that has them, in proportion to the bigne≈øs of their Bodies. From their fir≈øt ri≈øe from the Womb to their end, they grow by degrees narrower and narrower, and about their middle are the Trumpets of the Womb in≈øerted into them. They have a worm-like or ≈øucce≈ø≈øive motion as the Guts have, by which the Egg being received from the Trumpet is driven gently along till it come to the bottom of the Womb in Mares, and there becomes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: but in ≈øuch Creatures as bring forth many Young at one time, the Conceptions ≈øtay in the Horns till they are come to maturity, and never de≈øcend into the bottom of the Womb till they are about to be excluded.</p>
                        <p>By what has been ≈øaid, it appears, that the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Womb is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Seed of the Male, from which Seed a certain air or ≈øpirit ≈øteams through the Trumpets to the Te≈øticles, where impregnating one or more Eggs, tho≈øe that are ≈øo impregnated, are conveyed by the Trumpets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Horns, and by the≈øe into the bottom of the Womb, where they become Conceptions, and ≈øtay (according to Nature) ≈øo long till all their Parts are fini≈øhed, and they are become perfect Animals of their proper kind; and then the Womb being irritated by the motion and bigne≈øs of the Young, does by the help of the Mu≈øcles of the Belly, and the a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the Midriff exclude it. But having de≈øigned a particular di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of the generation of Animals to be annexed to this Treati≈øe, we ≈øhall pur≈øue it no further here.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of the <hi>Vagina</hi> or Sheath of the Womb, the Caruncles call'd <hi>myrtiformes,</hi> (of the ≈øhape of Myrtle-berries) the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris</hi> and the external Privity.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Vagina or Sheath. The myrti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The Clitoris. The outward Privity. The Lips. The Nymphs.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE ≈øhall not need to enter upon the de≈øcription of the Ve≈ø≈øels run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the <hi>Sheath</hi> of the Womb, they being wholly the ≈øame that are di≈øper≈øed through the Womb it ≈øelf, and therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may have recour≈øe to the former Chapter for them: nor is it nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ≈øpeak much of its ≈øub≈øtance, that being al≈øo much like to that of the Womb, though not ≈øo thick and ≈øtrong, but more ≈øoft, nervous and ≈øpongie. It is near half a yard long, being much of an equal width from one end to the other, but very uneven and wrinkled in its inner ≈øurface. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its lower ≈øide (or that ≈øide next the Belly) a very little di≈øtance from the external Privity, is the neck of the Bladder in≈øerted; oppo≈øite to which in its upper ≈øide it is ≈øtrongly knit to the Sphincter Mu≈øcle of the Ar≈øe-gut. There is no ≈øuch neck to di≈øtingui≈øh or ≈øeparate the Sheath from the bottom of the Womb, as Anatomi≈øts ≈øay there is in Women: but the Sheath it ≈øelf ≈øeems to be widened into what I call the bottom of the Womb.</p>
                        <p>Whether there be any ≈øuch Membrane that goes cro≈øs the <hi>Vagina</hi> in Mares that have never been cover'd, as Anatomi≈øts ≈øay there is in Maids, I never made any carefull examination, but believe there is none. But as for tho≈øe Caruncles or little kernelly knobs that are called <hi>myrtiformes,</hi> from their re≈øembling the Berries of the Myrtle in ≈øhape, they are to be found: yea they may be ≈øeen without di≈ø≈øection, if one look near the Privity of a Mare when ≈øhe is lu≈øtfull and de≈øires the Hor≈øe; for as ≈øhe opens the Orifice of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> one may di≈øcern the≈øe Caruncles to ≈øtrut out. They are ≈øaid to be four in number, the large≈øt of which ≈øtands ju≈øt at the mouth of the Water-pa≈ø≈øage, which it helps, partly, to clo≈øe up. Their u≈øe ≈øeems to be, by their roughne≈øs and unevenne≈øs to cau≈øe the greater plea≈øure to the Hor≈øe in Copulation.</p>
                        <p>On the ≈øame ≈øide of the <hi>Vagina</hi> with the Bladder is placed a long ≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie body called <hi>Clitoris,</hi> but lies a great deal farther within the <hi>Vagina</hi> than it is ≈øaid to doe in Women. For, that end of it which is next to the outward Privity is ≈øeven or eight fingers breadth from it, whereas in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it is de≈øcribed to be within an inch. Tho≈øe that would make the generative Parts of the Male and Female exactly to re≈øemble one the other, ≈øay that this body in the Female, an≈øwers to the Yard in the Male. And indeed it is of not an unlike ≈øub≈øtance, but is not the twentieth part ≈øo big. It is ≈øoft and ≈øpongie, but it is likely when the Mare is lu≈øtfull and de≈øires the Hor≈øe, it plumps up and ≈øuffers a ≈øort of erection, being the principal ≈øeat of plea≈øure in the Mare. It has two pair of Mu≈øcles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, as well as the Yard of the Hor≈øe. One pair is round, and ≈øprings from the Hip-bones: The other from the Sphincter of the Ar≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut. Its <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> ≈øpring from tho≈øe that are called <hi>Pudendae</hi> (or <hi>belonging to the Privity</hi>) and its <hi>Nerves,</hi> (which are pretty large,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57416:44"/>to make it the more ≈øen≈øible) ari≈øe from the ≈øame origine with tho≈øe that are di≈øper≈øed through the Sheath and Womb.</p>
                        <p> As to the outward Privity, the <hi>Labia</hi> or <hi>Lips</hi> are the fir≈øt things that offer them≈øelves. Be≈øides the common Coverings, to wit the Skin and fle≈øhy Membrane, they are ≈øtuft with a little ≈øpongy Fat. They ≈øerve to cover the outer orifice of the Sheath for comeline≈øs ≈øake, and to defend it from the cold, and In≈øects, or other injuries. The clo≈øing of the≈øe two makes that which is called the <hi>fi≈ø≈øure</hi> or chink. If one draw the Lips a little a≈øide, then appear the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> ≈øo called becau≈øe they ≈øtand next to the Urine as it ≈øpouts out from the Bladder, and hinder it from wetting the Lips. They are two, on each ≈øide one, ju≈øt within the Lips, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the jointing or middle of the Share-bone, at the lower ≈øide of the Privity, from whence they a≈øcend clo≈øe by each other to a little above half the breadth of the orifice of the Sheath, and end each in a blunt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Their ≈øub≈øtance is partly fle≈øhy and partly membranous; they are ≈øoft and ≈øpongie and of a red colour, having the ≈øame Ve≈ø≈øels with the <hi>Clitoris.</hi> Be≈øides their u≈øe to keep off the Pi≈øs from wetting the Lips, they ≈øerve, as well as the Lips, for clo≈øing up and covering the mouth of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> at lea≈øt ≈øo much of it as they reach unto.</p>
                        <p>And now we have done with all the Parts belonging to Generation, both in Male and Female.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING de≈øcribed all the Parts in Mares that do any ways ≈øerve for generation, and ≈øhewn their ≈øeveral u≈øes, I ≈øhould put an end to this Fir≈øt Book, but that it may be convenient to ≈øpeak ≈øomewhat of the Young contained in the Womb, for the conceiving and generating of which all the≈øe Parts were formed. But this I ≈øhall not do largely in this place, but onely ≈øummarily and in ≈øhort, referring the Reader for his fuller information and ≈øatisfaction to the Treati≈øe <hi>of the generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> annexed to the latter end of this Volume; where by ob≈øerving in what order and by what degrees the conceptions in other Creatures ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to perfect Animals of their kind, he may by the rule of proportion conceive how they proceed in Mares al≈øo.</p>
                        <p>Now before we come to ≈øpeak of the Membranes that inve≈øt the Foal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will be the ≈øubject of this Chapter, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to premi≈øe ≈øomething concerning the ways or Ve≈ø≈øels by which nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conveyed to it, whereby it grows from no bigger than a Bee to ≈øo va≈øt a bulk.</p>
                        <p>It is not long ago till when it was the general opinion, that the Young was nouri≈øhed by the Dam's Bloud; namely, that the hypoga≈øtrick and ≈øome of the ≈øpermatick Ve≈ø≈øels of the Dam did ino≈øculate with or open into the branches of the umbilical or Navel-ve≈ø≈øels of the Young, and ≈øo the bloud run from one to the other in a ready cour≈øe. And this Opinion had ≈øo far prevailed, and was taken for ≈øo certain a truth, that after the Young was excluded out of the Womb, and mu≈øt needs receive its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment by the mouth, they believed that it was nouri≈øhed by Bloud ≈øtill: For they thought that Milk was fir≈øt Bloud, onely it changed its colour, and its ta≈øte partly, in the white Kernels of the Dugs. This was a ≈øtrange fancy, that Nature ≈øhould thus doe and undoe, fir≈øt turn Chyle into Bloud, and then turn that Bloud again into a Liquor re≈øembling Chyle, and in truth differing very little from it. But this by the way. I ≈øay, the Dam's Ve≈ø≈øels were ≈øuppo≈øed to ino≈øculate with the Navel-ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of the Young; whereby Bloud was carried to it for its nouri≈øhment: but they never troubled their heads about making it out how the Young ≈øhould be nouri≈øhed before it had ever a Navel-ve≈ø≈øel, or before ever the Conception adhered to any part of the Womb. Now the Embryo or fir≈øt draught (as I may call it) of the Young is formed in all Creatures before the Navel-ve≈ø≈øels, and it is grown to a pretty bulk before they are ≈øo well perfected as to be capable of receiving any Liquor into them. And when they are perfectly formed, and can perform their office, whatever it be; in ≈øome Creatures, as particularly in a Sow, they never reach further than the <hi>Chorion</hi> or outmo≈øt Membrane wherein the Pig is included, and therefore have no contact or communication with tho≈øe of the Sow, who≈øe Veins and Arteries reach no further than the inmo≈øt Membrane of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57416:45"/>the Womb. And in the Creature we have now under con≈øideration, namely a Mare, it is near ≈øix months before the <hi>Chorion</hi> adhere to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Membrane of the Womb, (which how it does, we ≈øhall ≈øhew by and by.) Now the≈øe ob≈øervations plainly demon≈øtrate that the Young cannot be nouri≈øhed by the Bloud of the Dam, ≈øeeing there is no way whereby the Bloud can be conveyed to it, in any Creature for a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, and in ≈øome Creatures, at all.</p>
                        <p>Others ≈øufficiently di≈øcovering the errours of this Opinion, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to believe that the Young in the Womb was nouri≈øhed with the ≈øame Liquor while it was there, as it is after it comes into the World, namely Chyle a little refined, and not finding any other convenient ways (as they thought) whereby the Chyle could be conveyed to the Womb, have fancied that they have found Lacteal or Milky-ve≈ø≈øels going thither directly either from the great Kernel at the centre of the Me≈øentery, or from the common receptacle of the Chyle it ≈øelf: but others that favour not this Opinion, ≈øuppo≈øe tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels that the≈øe have fancied to be Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teals, to be onely Lympheducts, conveying the <hi>Lympha</hi> or ≈øuperfluous Water from the Womb to the common Receptacle, whither the <hi>Lympha</hi> of all the other Parts contained in the Lower Belly is by the ≈øame Ve≈ø≈øels likewi≈øe di≈øcharged. So that though this Opinion be very plau≈øible for its inventing ≈øo ready a way for the Chyles coming to the Womb; yet it is very probable that the≈øe ≈øuppo≈øed Milky-veins are nothing but Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts, and then the whole Suppo≈øition falls to the ground.</p>
                        <p>But yet though this ≈øecond Opinion be mi≈øtaken in the Ve≈ø≈øels that bring the Liquor to the Womb whereby the Young is nouri≈øhed, yet it ≈øeems to have hit right on the Liquor it ≈øelf. For as it cannot be Bloud for the rea≈øons I have before given, ≈øo there is no other Liquor in the Body but Chyle, that is capable of being turned into nouri≈øhment. For though they call that Juice, by which Bodies come to maturity are nouri≈øhed, (and al≈øo the Young in the Womb) <hi>nutritious Juice,</hi> yet that name onely denotes its <hi>office,</hi> and does not ≈øuppo≈øe that a Liquor quite di≈øtinct in <hi>nature</hi> from Bloud or Chyle is under≈øtood by that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it does indeed partake of the nature both of the Bloud and Chyle; for it is Chyle a little exalted or impregnated with the ≈øpirit and life of the Bloud. Now this Juice arrives at the Womb by the≈øe ways. Fir≈øt the Chyle a≈øcending from the common Receptacle by the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racick Duct to the right Ventricle of the Heart, it is ≈øent out from thence together with the Bloud into the Lungs, from whence they both return to the left ventricle of the Heart, out of which they are ejected into the <hi>Aorta</hi> or great Artery, by which means the Chyle runs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the Bloud into all the Parts of the Body; but when the Dam is with Young we may conceive that a greater quantity of it may tend towards the Womb than to other parts: even as it is probable that more wheyi≈øh or watery Humour accompanies that Bloud that flows by the Emulgent Arteries to the Kidneys, than that which flows to other Parts, becau≈øe Nature has appointed the Kidneys for the ≈øeparating of it from the Bloud. I ≈øay it is al≈øo likely that more Chyle de≈øcends to the Womb by the ≈øpermatick and hypoga≈øtrick Arteries than to any other part, becau≈øe a great quantity of it is to be ≈øeparated from the Bloud here for the nouri≈øhment of the Young. Now the≈øe Arteries, as all others in the Body, do divide them≈øelves ≈øo often, till they end in very ≈ømall capillary or hair-like threads, which terminate in the inmo≈øt Membrane of the

But all the branches of the≈øe Arteries about the Womb are much larger when the Female is with Young than at other times, which is an argument that nouri≈øhment is indeed brought by them. The greate≈øt difficulty is, how it can be di≈øcharged out of the Arteries into the Womb, and no Bloud go along with it. To ≈øolve this difficulty we mu≈øt con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Particles of ≈øeveral Liquors are of different figures, as ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe ≈øome round, ≈øome corner'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now we know that if two bodies of the <hi>≈øame</hi> bulk be one round, and another four≈øquare, the round will go through a hole which the four≈øquare body will not, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the four≈øquare body will pa≈øs through a hole that the round will not; accordingly as the hole is round or four≈øquare. And this may be the rea≈øon that the Chyle can pa≈øs out of the ≈ømall ends of the Arteries, and yet the Bloud cannot accompany it, but mu≈øt return back by the Veins. And be≈øides the difference of figure, it is probable the Particles of that Chyle that ouzes into the Womb, are of much <hi>≈ømaller</hi> bulk than tho≈øe of the Bloud, ≈øeeing it is a much thinner and watery body; and therefore may as ea≈øily be ≈øeparated from the Bloud into the Womb, as the Urine is by the Kidneys into the Ureters. And to further and a≈ø≈øi≈øt this ≈øeparation ≈øome do believe there is a certain fermentation in the Womb, even as there is in other Parts of the Body, where other Juices are ≈øeparated from the Bloud, as Choler in the Liver, and according to ≈øome, Urine in the Kidneys. But be the ≈øeparation by what means it will, that there is ≈øuch a thing is mo≈øt certain, and how the Young comes to partake of it for its nouri≈øhment we ≈øhall next ≈øhew.</p>
                        <p> While it was believed that a Conception was made of the Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male's Seed mixed together, it was ≈øomewhat difficult to imagine how ≈øuch a fluid ≈øub≈øtance ≈øhould ≈øo ≈øpeedily acquire ≈øo compact Membranes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, as we ≈øee it has in a few days. But now that it is believed that a Conception is nothing el≈øe but an Egg dropt off from the Te≈øticle and received into the Womb, that difficulty vani≈øhes, for tho≈øe Membranes do originally inve≈øt the Egg, even as we ≈øee the like Membranes lie under the ≈øhells of the Eggs of Fowls, and encompa≈ø≈øing the whole. The≈øe Membranes are at the fir≈øt but two, called <hi>Amnios</hi> and <hi>Chorion;</hi> but after a while there is a third commonly called <hi>Allantoides,</hi> or the Pudding-like Membrane.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:57416:47"/>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57416:47"/>
                        <p> That Membrane or Skin that immediately infolds the Young is called <hi>Amnios.</hi> It is very thin, ≈ømooth and clear, and in it is contained that Liquor out of which the Young is fir≈øt formed, and by which it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nouri≈øhed. That Liquor out of which the Young is formed, is originally in it, even while the Conception is under the form of an Egg: but that by which the Young is nouri≈øhed and its Parts increa≈øed, ≈øweats into this Membrane immediately out of the <hi>Chorion</hi> or outmo≈øt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane for the fir≈øt months, till the Navel-≈øtring is perfected, and that there grows a new Membrane betwixt the≈øe two, that contains a peculiar ≈øort of Liquor, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew by and by. But the Juice that is in the <hi>Amnios</hi> from fir≈øt to la≈øt (except that out of which the <hi>Embryo</hi> is <hi>formed</hi>) is Chyle, which at fir≈øt ≈øweats into it out of the <hi>Chorion,</hi> and afterwards is conveyed into it by the umbilical Arteries of the Young, who fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by its umbilical Veins. For the≈øe Arteries ≈øend many branches into the <hi>Amnios,</hi> which di≈øcharge them≈øelves into it, even as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga≈øtrick and ≈øpermatick Arteries do into the Womb. Now this Liquor that is thus collected in this inmo≈øt Membrane, does at fir≈øt nouri≈øh the <hi>Embryo</hi> or fir≈øt rudiments of the Young by appo≈øition, that is, tho≈øe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments do attract to them≈øelves ≈øuch particles of the Liquor as are ≈øuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them; and thereby their bulk comes to be encrea≈øed by degrees: but as ≈øoon as the Young has its Mouth and Stomach perfected, it then ≈øucks it up and drinks it in by its Mouth, and it pa≈ø≈øes by the ≈øame ways to the Heart as it does after the birth.</p>
                        <p> The ≈øecond Membrane, that is originally in the Egg, and that inve≈øts the Young from fir≈øt to la≈øt, is called the <hi>Chorion.</hi> This is ≈øomewhat thicker than the <hi>Amnios;</hi> it is ≈ømooth on its in≈øide, but rough and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual on its out≈øide. This Membrane drinks up that nutritious Juice that is emptied into the Womb from the hypoga≈øtrick and ≈øpermatick Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which Juice is again filtred as it were out of it into the <hi>Amnios</hi> for the nouri≈øhment of the Young. For the Liquor contained in this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is altogether the ≈øame with that of the <hi>Amnios.</hi> Now this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane for ≈øeveral months (five or ≈øix) adheres not to the Womb in any part, but the Young that is clad with it, lies as loo≈øe in the Womb, as a Bladder in a Foot-ball that is not at all tied to the leather. (Thus I ≈øay it is in a Mare, though in mo≈øt other Creatures this Membrane begin much ≈øooner to be fa≈øten'd to the Womb.) But at length fir≈øt of all there begin to grow in the ≈øurface of it certain reddi≈øh ≈øpecks or caruncles no bigger than a Vetch, and at the ≈øame time the Membrane grows thicker, and there appear innumerable Ve≈ø≈øels in it. And the≈øe Caruncles as they become more in number, ≈øo they grow broader in dimen≈øion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch as at la≈øt they are ≈øpread all over the <hi>Chorion,</hi> ≈øo that on its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide it ≈øeems to have lo≈øt the nature of a Membrane, and to have become a <hi>placenta</hi> or Womb-cake. At the ≈øame time that the≈øe Caruncles grow thus on this Membrane, the Navel-≈øtring penetrating the <hi>Amnios</hi> is in≈øerted into it, and tho≈øe numerous Ve≈ø≈øels that are ≈øeen in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> are onely branches of the Navel-arteries and Veins di≈øper≈øed through it. And now the <hi>Chorion</hi> by means of the Caruncles that grow upon it, adheres to the inner Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Womb, from whence the Navel-veins imbibe nutritious Juice and carry it to the Young for its ≈øu≈øtenance, (as ≈øhall be further ≈øhewed pre≈øently, when we come to ≈øpeak of the Navel-≈øtring.) But the Caruncles do not ≈øtick ≈øo fa≈øt to the Womb, but that they may be ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated without tearing, much le≈øs are there any Ana≈øtomo≈øes or Ino≈øcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57416:48"/>of the Ve≈ø≈øels that run through the <hi>Chorion</hi> with the hypoga≈øtrick or ≈øpermatick Ve≈ø≈øels of the Dam, as the Ancients believed. Nor is there in a Mare any of tho≈øe Glandules that are commonly called <hi>Cotyledons</hi> or Sawcers, ≈øticking to the inner Membrane of the Womb, into which the Caruncles of the <hi>Chorion</hi> are in≈øerted, like an Acorn into its cup, ≈øuch as are in Sheep and Goats: but the ≈øo often mentioned Caruncles ≈øtick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Membrane it ≈øelf, and ≈øeem to ≈øerve as Sponges to imbibe the nutritious Juice that plentifully bedews it; which having done, the ≈øaid Juice is ≈øuckt up by the mouths of the Navel-vein, as was ≈øaid before. Part of this Membrane does on each ≈øide bag out into the Horns of the Womb.</p>
                        <p> As ≈øoon as the Navel-≈øtring has penetrated the <hi>Amnios,</hi> there begins to appear a third Membrane betwixt the≈øe two already de≈øcribed, which contains a Liquor wholly different from what ≈øwims in <hi>them;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> we have ≈øhewn to be <hi>Chyle,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rine</hi> of the Young, which, while the Young is in the Womb, is not emptied out of the Bladder the common way, but there is a Pipe called <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rachus</hi> that pa≈ø≈øes from the bottom of the Bladder out at its Navel, and empties the Urine into this Membrane, in which it is collected to the quantity of many quarts. This Membrane is called <hi>Allantoides</hi> or Pudding-like, becau≈øe in many Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as Cows, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is of that ≈øhape, and ≈øeems to be onely the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rachus</hi> a little widened. But it is of another figure in Mares (as it is al≈øo in Women) and is of the ≈øame dimen≈øion with the other two already de≈øcribed, incompa≈ø≈øing the whole Young. It is more den≈øe than they, and may be ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øhed from them by this, that <hi>they</hi> are full of Ve≈ø≈øels, but <hi>this</hi> has not one, that one can di≈øcern. Although this Membrane appear not till the time afore≈øaid, yet 'tis like it was originally in the Egg; and at its appearance the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes empty, becau≈øe there is now no longer pa≈ø≈øage of any thing out of the <hi>Chorion</hi> into the <hi>Amnios,</hi> by rea≈øon of this Membrane and its Liquor interpo≈øing. Whence the <hi>Chorion</hi> claps pretty clo≈øe to the <hi>Allantoides,</hi> ≈øo that they cannot be ea≈øily ≈øeparated. In the Liquor contained in the <hi>Allantoides</hi> there ≈øwim ≈øeveral gobbets that look like as if they were fle≈øhy, but being pulled to pieces they appear skinny. They are ≈øuppo≈øed to be concretions of ≈øome part of the nutritious Juice that may come along with the Urine into this Membrane, wherein by its long ≈øtay it curdles into the≈øe kind of bodies. But there is one more notable one, that is ≈øaid to grow on the Forehead of the Colt, of the ≈øhape of a Tongue, and is called <hi>hippomanes,</hi> which, Tradition ≈øays, the Mare is wont to eat as ≈øoon as ≈øhe has foal'd; which if ≈øhe do not, ≈øhe will never care for her Foal. This they were wont to dry and powder, and to put into drink for a Love-potion, as if there were ≈øome witchery in it. But ≈øuch things I can ≈øay nothing to, having never experimented them. This Membrane ≈øticking pretty clo≈øe to the <hi>Chorion,</hi> bags out on each ≈øide into the Horns of the Womb as well as it. The Liquor contained in it, is Urine, as was ≈øaid above, which daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øes in quantity, being imported into it by the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rachus</hi> from the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Foal.</p>

The greate≈øt part of its length is contained in the <hi>Amnios,</hi> the re≈øt in the <hi>Allantoides;</hi> for as ≈øoon as it has penetrated that, it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and directly implanted into the <hi>Chorion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> The <hi>Vein</hi> is as big as both the Arteries, and ari≈øes out of the hollow or lower ≈øide of the Liver of the Young, and coming out ≈øingle with the re≈øt at the Navel, is immediately divided into two, which as they pa≈øs through the <hi>Amnios,</hi> ≈øend ≈øome twigs to it, and from thence continue their march through the <hi>Allantoides</hi> to the <hi>Chorion,</hi> in which and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles that grow upon it they terminate, being divided into innumerable branches. Its u≈øe is to imbibe the nutritious Juice and al≈øo the Bloud that is ≈øuperfluous to the nouri≈øhing of the≈øe Parts, and to convey them to the Young.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>Arteries</hi> being two, do ari≈øe on each ≈øide from the inner Iliacal Branches of the great Artery, (as is commonly held, but I have always ob≈øerved them to ≈øpring from the <hi>Aorta</hi> it ≈øelf before the divi≈øion) and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending by the ≈øides of the Bladder, they meet the Vein at the Navel, and there begin to be wreathed with it. Their march and in≈øertions are the ≈øame with tho≈øe of the Vein, onely they ≈øend more twigs into the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios</hi> than the Vein doth. Their u≈øe is to carry vital heat and nouri≈øhment to the Parts that include the Young, to wit to the <hi>Amnios, Chorion</hi> and its Caruncles: and be≈øides, its branches that are di≈øper≈øed through the <hi>Amnios</hi> do di≈øtill into it ≈øome of that nutritious Juice which could not be turned into Bloud by once circulating through the Heart of the Young. Which Juice being collected in the cavity of the <hi>Amnios,</hi> is drunk in by the Young at its mouth, and ≈øo pa≈ø≈øes the ≈øame ways as it does after the birth.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Of the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>dder.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Its ≈øub≈øtance. Number. Its Glands. The Paps. The Ve≈ø≈øels belonging to the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>dder. The milk-pipes. The u≈øe of the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>dder.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THOUGH the Udder be an <hi>external</hi> Part of the Lower Belly, yet we have deferr'd the de≈øcription of it till this place, becau≈øe of the dependance that it has upon the Womb, and its office of yielding the ≈øame nouri≈øhment to the Foal when it is excluded out of the Womb, as it was nouri≈øh'd by while it remain'd in it.</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øeated at the bottom of the Paunch upon the lower ends of the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles; very ≈ømall, if compar'd to the bigne≈øs of a Mare's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to its bulk in many other Creatures. When the Mare gives no ≈øuck, it almo≈øt di≈øappears.</p>
                        <p>It con≈øi≈øts of the common coverings, Fat, a multitude of Ve≈ø≈øels, Glands or Kernels, and Pipes to convey the Milk to the Paps that is ≈øeparated from the Ve≈ø≈øels in the Glands.</p>
                        <p>Now though when the Mare gives ≈øuck it ≈øeems to be but <hi>one</hi> roundi≈øh body, like a Brea≈øt with two Nipples, yet it truly con≈øi≈øts of <hi>two</hi> bodies, one being joined to the other onely by contiguity, for they have each their proper Ve≈ø≈øels, Pipes and Pap; and do indeed appear to the eye to be di≈øtinct when the Mare is neither with Foal nor ≈øuckles one.</p>
                        <p>The greate≈øt part of its bulk con≈øi≈øts of <hi>Glands,</hi> which are many in number, though they be ≈øo united to one another as to appear one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued body to an unwary ob≈øerver, which they come to do from that Fat that fills up the ≈øpaces between them, and is much of the ≈øame colour with the Glands. There is one Gland greater than the re≈øt ≈øeated at the root of each Pap. By means of the≈øe Glands it is that the Milk is ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Bloud, as ≈øhall be further ≈øhewn by and by.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Paps</hi> are round in ≈øhape and of a ≈øpongie ≈øub≈øtance, cloathed with a thinner Skin than the re≈øt of the Udder. At their head or end they have many little holes through which the Milk i≈ø≈øues when the Foal ≈øucks.</p>
                        <p>The Udder has all ≈øorts of <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> Veins, Arteries, Nerves and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts; and be≈øides the≈øe it has peculiar Pipes for containing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Milk. The <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> are branches of the <hi>Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtricks,</hi> which proceed from the <hi>internal</hi> Iliack branches of the <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta:</hi> 'tis likely there come ≈øome twigs to it al≈øo from the <hi>external</hi> branches, which are called the <hi>Epiga≈øtrick</hi> Ve≈ø≈øels. Its <hi>Nerves</hi> I have not examin'd, but 'tis very probable they are the ≈øame with tho≈øe di≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed into the Matrix and Sheath, which are twigs of the Interco≈øtal pair and of ≈øome of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum.</hi> Its <hi>Lympheducts</hi> are pretty numerous, and tend, as all tho≈øe of the Lower Belly do, to the common Receptacle of the Chyle at the centre of the Me≈øentery.</p>
                        <p>It has al≈øo a peculiar ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øels, which may be called <hi>Milk-pipes,</hi> being the Repo≈øitories or Store-hou≈øes of the Milk. At the root of each Pap they are but one on each ≈øide, but a great many ≈ømaller ones coming from every part of the Udder di≈øcharge them≈øelves into this one, when the Pap is ≈øuckt by the Foal. But the Pipes belonging to one Pap have no communication with tho≈øe that belong to the other, but in re≈øpect of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57416:52"/>the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels the two ≈øides of the Udder are as di≈øtinct Parts, as the Brea≈øts of a Woman are di≈øtinct one from another, as was noted before. The≈øe Pipes have been mi≈øtaken by ≈øome to be true Milky-veins, as if ≈øome of the Milky-veins of the Me≈øentery reached hither. But ≈øeeing there are no foot≈øteps of them in the track betwixt the Me≈øentery and Udder, we may well deny them to be found in the Udder it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Udder is to prepare and ≈øeparate the Milk for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment of the Foal, which it does in this manner. The Chyle of the Mare being mixed with her Bloud in the Heart, flows from thence along with it by the Arteries into all Parts of the Body in the circulation, but mo≈øt plentifully ('tis probable) towards the Udder, even as it does to the Womb while the Mare is with Foal. The Arteries that convey it immediately to the Udder are the hypoga≈øtrick Branches, which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in its Glands do ≈øquirt or ≈øtrain the Chyle through them into the Milk-pipes. And as for the Bloud that was mixed with the Chyle in the Arteries, that being of a thicker body, or con≈øi≈øting of Particles of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form, cannot enter the narrow pores of the Glands, and therefore is received by the ≈ømall mouths of the Veins that are likewi≈øe in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them. So that it appears to be an erroneous Opinion, That Milk is made of Bloud, if we ≈øpeak of Bloud properly ≈øo called; yet ≈øeeing the Chyle, when it is confu≈øedly jumbled with the Bloud in the Arteries, is not ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øhable from it, but the whole Ma≈øs ≈øeems to be homogeneal or of the ≈øame nature, in a large and le≈øs proper ≈øen≈øe we may affirm it to be ≈øo made. After that the Chyle is thus ≈øeparated by the Glands, it drills along the Milk-pipes, out of the ≈ømaller into the larger, in which it is re≈øerved for the u≈øe of the Foal.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING fini≈øhed the Fir≈øt Book, wherein I have ab≈øolved or explained all the <hi>Natural</hi> Parts contained within the Lower <hi>Venter,</hi> as well nutritive as generative, and annexed a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of the Foal in the Matrix or Womb; order of di≈ø≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires that in the next place I come to treat of the Middle <hi>Venter,</hi> the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Che≈øt, and the <hi>Vital</hi> Parts contained therein.</p>
                        <p>Where, in this one ≈øtep higher that I have climbed, I am methinks much delighted to ≈øee, how Nature in this place di≈øports her ≈øelf, having as in a curious Cabinet lockt up, as it were, her mo≈øt exqui≈øite pieces of Workman≈øhip, the <hi>Vital</hi> In≈øtruments, by who≈øe motion the life of the Creature is continued. Which motion is performed by ≈øo ju≈øt a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poi≈øe, as no art of Man could ever with all their contrivances be able in the lea≈øt to imitate. Nay <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> that wi≈øe Philo≈øopher, who was in his time thought to be the neare≈øt of coun≈øel to Nature, was not able
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57416:54"/>(notwith≈øtanding his incomparable ≈øagacity) to find out the true cau≈øe of the Vital motion, any more than he was, to find out the reciprocal Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea.</p>
                        <p>The Place wherein the≈øe In≈øtruments are contained, is called the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> or Che≈øt, which is compo≈øed of or environed with the≈øe Parts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt it is bounded or circum≈øcribed, above, by the Coller-bones, and below by the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> or Midriff; on the fore-part by the Brea≈øt-bone, and on the hinder part by the Spondyls or Back-bones; and on the two ≈øides by the true and ba≈øtard Ribs and Interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles. All which Parts are framed and compo≈øed by Nature for the benefit of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well for the <hi>defence</hi> of the contained Parts from external Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as for the u≈øe of <hi>Re≈øpiration</hi> or breathing: both which are very needfull; for without them the Creature cannot be pre≈øerved. Now that it might ≈øerve for the≈øe ends, it was nece≈ø≈øary it ≈øhould con≈øi≈øt of ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Parts; for ≈øhould it have been made all bony, it could not have been contracted and dilated as occa≈øion ≈øerved, whereby the Lungs could not have had the liberty to play as now they have: And if it had been wholly fle≈øhy, then would not the contained Parts have been ≈øufficiently fenced. It is therefore made partly bony, partly gri≈øtly, and partly fle≈øhy, that it might the better perform both the offices afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <p>In the next place I come to ≈øpeak particularly to the <hi>Inve≈øting</hi> Parts of the Che≈øt, ≈øome of which are <hi>Common,</hi> and others <hi>Proper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Common inve≈øting</hi> or <hi>containing</hi> Parts are the ≈øame as the Lower Belly hath, namely the Scarf-skin, the true Skin, the fle≈øhy Pannicle, the Fat, and the common Membrane of the Mu≈øcles. Of all which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving di≈øcour≈øed at large in the Fir≈øt Book, we ≈øhall ≈øay nothing of them here.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Proper containing</hi> Parts of the Che≈øt are the Mu≈øcles, the Bones, the <hi>Pleura</hi> or Membrane that cloaths its in≈øide, the Midriff and the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtinum,</hi> which is the Skin that goes acro≈øs from the Brea≈øt to the Back, and parts the Lungs, called by ≈øome, the Partition-wall.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>contained</hi> or <hi>inve≈øted</hi> Parts, are the Heart with the Heart-bag called the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and by ≈øome the Pur≈øe of the Heart, the Lungs and part of the Weazand or Wind-pipe, by Anatomi≈øts called <hi>A≈øpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> or Rough-artery, and ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels, with the Trunks of <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> who≈øe a≈øcending branches are underpropped by the <hi>Thymus,</hi> or Kernel in the Throat.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles why ≈øo called. The External. The Internal. Their number. Their action.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THERE are ≈øeveral pairs of <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> that lie upon the Che≈øt on the out≈øide of the Ribs; but becau≈øe one may ea≈øily enough cut open the Che≈øt for examining the Parts contained in it, without defacing any part of tho≈øe Mu≈øcles, we ≈øhall omit to ≈øpeak of them in this place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Reader to the Book of the Mu≈øcles; and here onely de≈øcribe the <hi>Interco≈øtal,</hi> which in laying open the Brea≈øt, whiles one breaks the gri≈øtly ends of the Ribs, happen part of them to be defaced.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Mu≈øcles are called <hi>Interco≈øtal</hi> from their being placed <hi>between the Ribs,</hi> and filling up the ≈øpaces between them. Betwixt every two Ribs there are placed two of the≈øe Mu≈øcles, the one lying upon the other; the uppermo≈øt being called the <hi>External,</hi> and the undermo≈øt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>External</hi> one takes his ri≈øe from the lower part of the upper Ribs, and ends in the upper part of the lower.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Internal</hi> takes his ri≈øe contrary to the former; for it ari≈øes or takes its original from the upper part of the lower Rib, and ends in the lower part of the upper.</p>
                        <p>Now it is to be under≈øtood that tho≈øe are called the upper Ribs that are next to the Head, and tho≈øe the lower, that are next to the Paunch.</p>
                        <p>And as the≈øe Mu≈øcles do differ as to their original and in≈øertion, ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe in the cour≈øe of their Fibres; for although they be both furni≈øhed with oblique or ≈ølanting Fibres, yet they run contrary ways, cro≈ø≈øing one the other, and making as it were a St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Cro≈øs, or the letter X.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Mu≈øcles are in number ≈øixty four, that is to ≈øay on each ≈øide thirty two, there being on each ≈øide of the Hor≈øe ≈øeventeen Ribs, and between every Rib two Mu≈øcles, as I have before intimated.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>action</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is to a≈ø≈øi≈øt Re≈øpiration by widening, and contracting the Che≈øt. Fir≈øt the <hi>external</hi> ones ≈øerve to rai≈øe the Ribs and draw them backward, whereby the Cavity of the Che≈øt is enlarged, and thereby free room made for the Air to enter into the Lungs in <hi>In≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or taking in the breath. And on the contrary the <hi>internal</hi> pull in the Ribs by drawing them ≈ølanting downwards towards the Brea≈øt-bone, whereby the Che≈øt is ≈øtraitned, and thereby the Air, wherewith the Lungs are puff'd up, expelled, which action is called <hi>Expiration,</hi> or breathing forth. But the≈øe Mu≈øcles are not of them≈øelves alone ≈øufficient for the≈øe actions, but they a≈ø≈øi≈øt towards them, being aided by the other that lie upon the Che≈øt, by the Midriff, and by the Lungs them≈øelves.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> or Coat which inve≈øts or lines the Ribs on the In≈øide.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The original of the Pleura or Rib-skin. Its Perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS Coat or Skin called the <hi>Pleura,</hi> is the Skin which covereth all the Ribs on the in≈øide of the Che≈øt, being of the ≈øame nature and u≈øe here, as the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly is in the Lower Belly. It is al≈øo of the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance as the Rim of the Belly is, but much ≈øtronger and thicker, though <hi>Riolanus</hi> affirmeth the contrary as to Men.</p>
                        <p>It is as it were of a middle nature or temper, that is, neither too hard nor too ≈øoft; not too hard, le≈øt it ≈øhould not reach and yield in the act of Re≈øpiration, and ≈øo hinder the motion of the Che≈øt; neither too ≈øoft, le≈øt the motion of the Che≈øt ≈øhould violate it: but it is rather hard than ≈øoft, the better to defend the Vital Parts.</p>
                        <p>It is believed to take its <hi>original</hi> from the Coats of the Nerves of the Spinal Marrow, which come out of the Back-bones (or <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Back) into the Che≈øt, and is therefore thought to be continued with the Coats of the Brain: wherefore it is ob≈øerved to be thicker upon the back part of the Che≈øt than any where el≈øe, where it ≈øticks ≈øo clo≈øe to the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, that it can hardly be ≈øeparated.</p>
                        <p>It is all over double, that the Interco≈øtal-ve≈ø≈øels might run without danger between its Membranes, and by it be pre≈øerved from the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Ribs, which would be apt to violate or break them.</p>
                        <p>The outward Skin of this Coat, namely that which is next to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Che≈øt, is harder and thicker; and the inward (which is fa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Ribs) is ≈øofter and thinner. Now between the≈øe two Skins is bred that mortal Di≈øea≈øe (in Men) called the Pleuri≈øie, by which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> (for being in his time the honour of his Univer≈øity and Country) was notwith≈øtanding the great pains he took in the inquiry into and finding out remedies again≈øt this Di≈øea≈øe, (as his learned Works make appear, by which great benefit hath accrued to others) was, I ≈øay, him≈øelf by the tyranny of it taken from among≈øt the Living.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Pleura</hi> is perforated in many places, for the Ingate and Outgate of the Ve≈ø≈øels. For above, it letteth out the Jugular and Axillary Arteries and Veins, and below, through the Midriff, the Trunks of the hollow Vein and great Artery. Be≈øides where it receiveth in the Nerves of the wandring pair, the Windpipe, and both letteth in and out the Gullet.</p>
                        <p>Its proper <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> are, <hi>Veins</hi> from the <hi>Vena ≈øine pari,</hi> or Vein without a pair, and from the upper Interco≈øtal Vein. Its <hi>Arteries</hi> ≈øpring al≈øo from the upper Interco≈øtals (as tho≈øe from the Subclavian) which de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to about the ≈øeventh or eighth Rib: below which it receives twigs of Arteries from the back part of the de≈øcending great Artery. It has as many pairs of <hi>Nerves</hi> (wanting one) as there are Joints in the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone the whole length of the Che≈øt: for betwixt each Joint there comes out a pair; but then the uppermo≈øt and lowe≈øt Joints being reckoned for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57416:55"/>the two extremes, (and not a pair of Nerves for either extreme) there mu≈øt be one pair of Nerves le≈øs than there are Joints. The Joints there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (or <hi>vertebrae</hi>) being ≈øeventeen, there mu≈øt onely ≈øixteen pair of Nerves be reckoned to the Che≈øt. Now the≈øe Nerves as ≈øoon as ever they come out of the Joint, are immediately divided into the <hi>fore</hi> and <hi>hinder-branches.</hi> Of which the <hi>fore-branches</hi> ≈øerve the Interco≈øtal Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and the <hi>Pleura;</hi> but the <hi>hinder</hi> are be≈øtowed on the Mu≈øcles that lie upon the Back.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of it is much like that of the Rim of the Belly; for (as hath been ≈øaid) as the Rim of the Belly is ≈øtretched about all the Lower Belly, and furni≈øheth all the Bowels therein contained with Coats or Skins, (every Bowel with a particular Coat) ≈øo doth this <hi>Pleura</hi> the Bowels of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <hi>Venter:</hi> for it is ≈øtretched about all the Cavity of the Che≈øt, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Coat to every particular Part therein contained, (either medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or immediately.) It covers al≈øo the Interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles, and makes the upper Membrane of the Midriff. Next to the Cavity of the Che≈øt it is bedewed with a watery humour, that the Lungs which lie again≈øt it on their out≈øide, may move the more glibly, and not be offended by its roughne≈øs.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm why ≈øo called. Its ri≈øe. Its ≈øub≈øtance. Its Perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. The ≈øeveral u≈øes of the Midriff. 1. It a≈ø≈øi≈øts Re≈øpiration. 2. Its motion helps the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtribution of the Chyle. 3 It helps to expel the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and in Mares the Foal. 4. It ≈øerves to divide the Abdomen from the Che≈øt.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Diaphragm</hi> (or <hi>Midriff</hi>) is ≈øo called from its office of di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing or ≈øeparating; becau≈øe it ≈øeparateth or di≈øtingui≈øheth the Bowels of the <hi>lower,</hi> from the In≈øtruments of Life and Re≈øpiration in the <hi>middle</hi> Belly.</p>
                        <p>It is a Mu≈øcle, long and round, ≈øeated at the lower part of the Che≈øt, overthwart which it runs, ≈øloping a little lower towards the Paunch back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It hath a figure and action different from all other Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>It is as broad as the Che≈øt is wide: for its edges are knit to the lower part of the Brea≈øt-bone, and all round on each ≈øide to the Ribs, and to the lowe≈øt vertebral Joint of the Che≈øt.</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øaid to ari≈øe from its two long and fle≈øhy Productions, which ≈øpringing from the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loins (to the mu≈øcles whereof they are ≈øtrongly knit) do, as they go upwards, grow wider and wider, till they come to the lowe≈øt <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt, where they grow and unite together, and ≈øo ≈øpread them≈øelves into this Mu≈øcle called the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff. Others, though they grant that the≈øe are part of its original, yet think that it does equally ari≈øe from its whole fle≈øhy circumference, by which it adheres to the ends of the lowe≈øt Ribs. And a third opinion is, that its original is from its centre or middle where its Nerve is in≈øerted into it, from that common Maxim of <hi>Galen</hi>'s, That whereever the Nerve is in≈øerted, <hi>there</hi> is the head of the Mu≈øcle. But as that Maxim does not hold in <hi>all other</hi> Mu≈øcles, ≈øo <hi>this</hi> being a Mu≈øcle of a peculiar ≈øhape and u≈øe, it may well be excepted therefrom, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the centre of the Midriff is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57416:56"/>tendinous, which the origine of a Mu≈øcle does not u≈øe to be, but onely its end.</p>
                        <p>As for its <hi>≈øub≈øtance,</hi> it is partly fle≈øhy, partly nervous and partly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous. For Membranes, becau≈øe it requireth great ≈øtrength (it being in continual motion) it is furni≈øhed with two, and tho≈øe very ≈øtrong ones, the uppermo≈øt of which it hath from the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and the lowermo≈øt from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or Rim of the Belly. To the uppermo≈øt the lower part of the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> is knit, (and of the Heart-bag in Men, but not in Hor≈øes or other Brutes) and ≈øometimes the lower tips or ends of the two great Lobes of the Lungs. Its circumference is fle≈øhy, and its middle or centre nervous, in which part a wound is mortal, but one in the fle≈øhy ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times admits of cure.</p>
                        <p>It hath in it ≈øeveral <hi>perforations</hi> or <hi>holes,</hi> ≈øome of which are little, and others bigger. The little ones are the <hi>pores,</hi> through which the Vapours are ≈øaid to a≈øcend from the lower Parts into the Che≈øt; but be≈øides that ≈øuch a≈øcent of impure Vapours from the Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the Che≈øt, where the Vital Parts are ≈øeated, would be very inconvenient and prejudicial, I think the Midriff is ≈øo compact a body, and its Membranes ≈øo clo≈øe, that we may either deny any <hi>pores</hi> at all, or however that they admit not any ≈øuch ≈øteams. The <hi>larger</hi> holes (being tho≈øe that ought to be reckon'd alone for ≈øuch) are, <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> that which is very near its middle or centre, but ≈øomething towards the right ≈øide, which gives pa≈ø≈øage for the Trunk of the hollow Vein a≈øcending from the Liver. The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is on the left ≈øide of the centre, being bigger than the former, and ≈øomewhat back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder; and this ≈øerves for the letting forth of the Gullet and two Nerves which go to the Stomach. There is al≈øo a <hi>third</hi> hole more backwards by the <hi>vertebrae,</hi> for the through-fare of the great Artery, and the Vein without a fellow, and for the Nerve which Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> di≈øtingui≈øhes from the wandring or eighth pair, by the name of the Interco≈øtal.</p>
                        <p>The Midriff hath <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of all ≈øorts; for it hath <hi>Veins</hi> ari≈øing from the Trunk of the hollow Vein, which are called <hi>Venae phrenicae,</hi> and al≈øo ≈øome twigs branching to it from the <hi>Vena adipo≈øa,</hi> or Fat-vein, ≈øo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is mo≈øtly be≈øtowed on the fat Membrane that inve≈øts the Kidneys.</p>
                        <p>It hath <hi>Arteries</hi> from the Trunk of the great Artery, called al≈øo <hi>Phrenicae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Nerves</hi> are in number two, proceeding from the ≈øpinal Marrow at the third or fourth jointing of the Rack-bones or <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, from whence they de≈øcend through the cavity of the Che≈øt, being in their cour≈øe ≈øu≈øtained and ≈øtrengthened by the <hi>Media≈øtinum,</hi> le≈øt by any violent motion they ≈øhould be hurt. As ≈øoon as the≈øe Nerves reach the Midriff, they enter it in its centre, and thence di≈øper≈øe them≈øelves into its whole ≈øub≈øtance, terminating in it. But be≈øides the≈øe ≈øome have ob≈øerved ≈ømall twigs to be ≈øent into it from the Nerves of the eighth pair, as they de≈øcend through it toward the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>Various are the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øes</hi> that might be a≈øcribed unto the Midriff, the chief are the≈øe that follow. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> It is the principal Mu≈øcle that a≈ø≈øi≈øts the action of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration. Which action whether it be animal and voluntary, or natural and involuntary, has occa≈øion'd great di≈øputes. True it is, that it moves in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well while we ≈øleep, as when we are awake, ≈øo that our Will, which in ≈øleep is dormant as well as the Body, ≈øeems not to be nece≈ø≈øary to its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and yet we can hinder it from moving when we plea≈øe by holding in our breath. We may therefore call its motion, a mixt motion, to wit, partly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57416:57"/>
                           <hi>voluntary</hi> (or rather <hi>≈øpontaneous</hi> in Bea≈øts, becau≈øe they have not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Will) and partly <hi>natural.</hi> Which motion is performed on this manner. In taking in ones breath it is ≈øtretched out and becomes plain and ≈øtiff, pre≈ø≈øing down a little the Parts contained in the Lower Belly: but in letting out ones breath, it is relaxed and a≈øcends ≈øomewhat up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Che≈øt, being partly driven up thither by the a≈øcent of the Bowels of the Lower Belly, which in expiration is a little ≈øtraitned by its Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and therefore the Parts contained therein as they have le≈øs room breadthways, mu≈øt have more lengthways. Now we mu≈øt note, that onely one ≈øort of motion agrees to one Mu≈øcle, to wit, that of contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that of re≈øtitution or relaxation is owing to the oppo≈øite Mu≈øcle, as was ≈øhewed at large in the Fir≈øt Book, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. The proper motion of the Midriff therefore is onely in In≈øpiration or taking in ones breath, when all its Fibres being contracted quite round, it is ≈øtretched out plain, ≈øomewhat like the Parchment upon a Drum's head: but when it is relaxed and becomes flaggy in Expiration, that is onely a motion of re≈øtitution, and is not owing to it ≈øelf, but to tho≈øe Mu≈øcles that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtringe or ≈øtraiten the Che≈øt, which are that called <hi>≈øacrolumbus,</hi> and the <hi>triangularis</hi> or three-corner'd one, which two lie on the out≈øide of the Ribs as ≈øhall be ≈øhewn in the Book of the Mu≈øcles; and la≈øtly, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interco≈øtals, de≈øcribed before in the ≈øecond Chapter, to which ≈øome of the Mu≈øcles of the Lower Belly perhaps yield ≈øome a≈ø≈øi≈øtance.</p>
                        <p> 
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> By its a≈øcending and de≈øcending, and ≈øo occa≈øioning the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be always in a motion upwards and downwards, it a≈ø≈øi≈øts them in driving forward the Liquors or whatever el≈øe contained in them, and ≈øo helps the di≈øtribution of the Chyle, which by the wormlike motion of the Guts alone could not ≈øo well be ≈øent through tho≈øe innumerable ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels through which it is to pa≈øs. And this I take to be a con≈øiderable u≈øe of it, though few Anatomi≈øts have taken any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
                        <p> A <hi>third</hi> u≈øe is to help forward the expul≈øion of the Excrements, and a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Mare in the time of her foaling. For in both tho≈øe offices the Midriff by holding in the breath is kept on the tenters as it were and pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed down upon the Parts contained in the Lower Belly that are next it, and tho≈øe do ≈øucce≈ø≈øively bear hard upon others that are next them, whereby every Part contained therein is ≈øomewhat ≈øtraitned, and ≈øo what≈øoever is contained in any of them, be it the Dung, Urine or Foal, is ≈øqueezed out and expelled.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>la≈øt</hi> u≈øe is what was mentioned at the beginning of this Chapter, namely, to di≈øtingui≈øh the Lower Belly with its natural Parts, from the Che≈øt and its vital Parts; le≈øt from the inferiour ignoble Parts noi≈øom Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ≈øhould a≈øcend up to the more noble, ≈øuch as are tho≈øe contained in the Che≈øt.</p>

                        </head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinum why ≈øo called. Its ri≈øe and ≈øub≈øtance. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its u≈øes.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS Membrane is called by the Latins <hi>Media≈øtinum,</hi> from its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of partitioning or dividing, becau≈øe it divides the Che≈øt into two parts, ≈øtanding acro≈øs the <hi>middle</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>It is derived or hath its original from the <hi>Pleura</hi> or Rib-coat, of which we have already ≈øpoken in the third Chapter. For the <hi>Pleura</hi> ≈øpringing from the Back-bone, keeps its way on each ≈øide of the cavity of the Che≈øt (cloathing the in≈øide of the Ribs) till it comes to the Brea≈øt-bone, where the two Membranes join together, but do <hi>not</hi> unite into one. From the Brea≈øt-bone the≈øe two Membranes hold a direct cour≈øe back again towards the Back-bone through the middle of the Che≈øt, but before they have gone an Inch, they begin to ≈øeparate again, and that ≈øo far from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by degrees, as to make a cavity wide enough for containing the Heart and the Heart-bag. But when they are arrived near the Back, they join together again. Note that the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> being compo≈øed of the doubling of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> mu≈øt con≈øi≈øt of four Membranes when uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (though onely of two where divided) ≈øeeing the <hi>Pleura</hi> it ≈øelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts of two. It is wholly membranous, as is the <hi>Pleura</hi> of which it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ≈ømooth on the out≈øide towards the Lungs, but rough on its in≈øide towards the Heart, by rea≈øon that the Heart-bag adheres to it by ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fibres.</p>
                        <p>Between the duplicature of this Membrane there are many ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels of all ≈øorts di≈øper≈øed. For fir≈øt there are <hi>Veins</hi> branching to it from the <hi>Phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> or Midriff-vein and from the ≈øolitary Vein or <hi>Vena ≈øine pari;</hi> it has likewi≈øe one proper Vein of its own from the ≈øubclavian branch, called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its own name, <hi>Media≈øtina.</hi> Secondly, its <hi>Arteries</hi> come from the <hi>Phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> or Midriff-artery, which ≈øpring out of the de≈øcending Trunk of the great Artery. Thirdly, it hath <hi>Nerves</hi> from the Phrenick or Midriff twigs of tho≈øe two branches of the eighth pair that de≈øcend through it to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orifice of the Stomach. <hi>Bartholin</hi> a≈øoribes al≈øo <hi>Lympheducts</hi> unto it.</p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57416:58"/>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> is fir≈øt, to divide the Che≈øt and Lungs into two parts, that if any hurtfull Accident ≈øhould happen to one of the ≈øides, the other notwith≈øtanding might be pre≈øerved. And this hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved by Anatomi≈øts, who have found in di≈ø≈øections the one ≈øide or Lobe of the Lungs wa≈øted and almo≈øt dryed away in Phthi≈øical and Con≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Per≈øons, and at the ≈øame time the other hath been perfectly fre≈øh and ≈øound. And it hath been likewi≈øe ≈øeen and ob≈øerved in wounds of the Che≈øt, that if therewith one Lobe of the Lungs ≈øhould happen to be hurt ≈øo much as to occa≈øion the lo≈øs of the u≈øe of that Lobe, yet the other by performing his part hath pre≈øerved life.</p>
                        <p>The next u≈øe of the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> is to permit the Heart in the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag to hang dangling in a free po≈øture, that in its motion it might not ≈øtrike again≈øt the bony ≈øides of the Che≈øt.</p>
                        <p>Again, it ≈øerves to ≈øu≈øtain and pre≈øerve the Ve≈ø≈øels running through it; and by its being knit to the Midriff, pre≈øerves <hi>that</hi> al≈øo from being drawn too much downwards by the weight of the Bowels of the Lower Belly, e≈øpecially by the Liver, who≈øe ≈øu≈øpen≈øory Ligament hangs by it.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the <hi>Thymus</hi> or great Kernel at the Throat; and of the Pur≈øe of the Heart called <hi>Pericardium,</hi> together with the water contained therein.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>What the Thymus is. Its u≈øe. The Ve≈ø≈øeli which pa≈øs over it. What the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium is. From whence it takes its original. The ≈øub≈øtance of the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium. Its Perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. Its u≈øe. Of the Water contained in the Pericar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. The u≈øes of the Water. Of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Che≈øt.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Thymus</hi> (named the Sweet-bread by ≈øome) is a glandulous or kernelly body, ≈øoft and ≈øpongie, placed in the upper part of the Che≈øt near the hole of the Throat, lying upon the ends of the Clavicles or Collar-bones.</p>
                        <p>It hath its name <hi>Thymus</hi> from the leaf of Time, which it very much re≈øembleth in ≈øhape.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to ≈øerve as a Boul≈øter or Pillow for the Veins and Arteries to pa≈øs over or lie upon, to keep them from the hardne≈øs of the Collar-bones, the ≈øharpne≈øs of which would el≈øe be apt to break them or fret them a≈øunder.</p>
                        <p>Now the Ve≈ø≈øels which do cro≈øs over this <hi>Thymus</hi> are the hollow Vein and the great Artery, with the many divi≈øions and branches of the ≈øame, which are in number many, di≈øper≈øed from thence into mo≈øt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Parts of the forepart of the Body, as ≈øome to the Shoulder-blades, and ≈øo down the Fore-legs; again, ≈øome to the Neck and Head, namely the internal and external Jugular Veins, and the Carotid Arteries; as al≈øo tho≈øe branches which run all along the Belly, which are by us Farriers called the Liver-veins. This Kernel is bigger in Foals than it is in grown Hor≈øes in proportion to their Bodies; and in Calves it is pretty large, and is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a dainty delicate bit.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to treat of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> or Pur≈øe of the Heart, or Heart-bag, for by the≈øe ≈øeveral nominations or names it goes. This is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57416:59"/>that Coat or Skin which compa≈ø≈øeth the Heart, and in which the Heart hangeth, it being for that purpo≈øe made in figure like it.</p>
                        <p>It takes its original at the ba≈øis or upper and broad end of the Heart, from the outer Coats which compa≈øs the Ve≈ø≈øels that enter into the Heart, which Coats do ≈øpring from the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> is thick and ≈øomething hard, though not ≈øo hard as to hurt the Lungs when it pre≈ø≈øeth again≈øt them, or they again≈øt it; neither is it too ≈øoft, le≈øt it ≈øhould it ≈øelf be hurt by the hardne≈øs of the Ribs, which in ≈øtrong pul≈øations of the Heart it beats again≈øt, the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> onely coming between: but being placed between two contraries, I mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ≈øoft Lungs and hard Bones, it ought to have its ≈øub≈øtance of a middle nature between both. On the out≈øide it is rough and fibrous, adhering in many places to the <hi>Media≈øtinum;</hi> but within, it is ≈ømooth and ≈ølippery, that the Heart might move more freely in it.</p>
                        <p>It is perforated in <hi>five</hi> places; namely on the <hi>right</hi> ≈øide by the a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Trunk of the hollow Vein, which comes up from the Liver and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the right Ventricle of the Heart; and by the Subclavian Vein which de≈øcends from the Channel-bones into the ≈øame Ventricle; and thirdly by the Pulmonary Artery which goes out of the right Ventricle into the Lungs. On its <hi>left</hi> ≈øide it is perforated by the Pulmonary Vein which comes from the Lungs and enters the left Ventricle of the Heart; and la≈øtly by the great Artery that pa≈ø≈øes out of the ≈øaid Ventricle.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Veins</hi> that it is furni≈øhed with, it receiveth at the lower part of it from the <hi>Phrenick</hi> or Midriff-vein, and at the upper part from the Axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries; but the Ve≈ø≈øels from each place are mighty ≈ømall.</p>
                        <p>There are no Arteries derived to it from any place, that are vi≈øible; and the rea≈øon ≈øuppo≈øed is, becau≈øe it is ≈øo near the Heart, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ≈øupplied from it with vital heat and ≈øpirit. But ≈øeeing the Heart it ≈øelf is not without Arteries, though it be reckon'd the fountain of life, much le≈øs can any other part be ≈øuppo≈øed to be, and therefore neither this, though they are ≈øo ≈ølender as not to be di≈øcernible.</p>
                        <p>Tho≈øe ≈ømall <hi>Nerves</hi> it is furni≈øhed with, are branched to it from the left recurrent Nerves of the eighth or wandring pair.</p>
                        <p>To the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels <hi>Bartholin</hi> adds <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> which ≈øerve to drink up part of the Liquor contained in the Heart-bag, to hinder its two great encrea≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Heart-bag, which is, to cover and pre≈øerve the Heart, and to contain a certain moi≈øture or Humour in it for the u≈øes after-mentioned. Now concerning this Humour there are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous di≈øcour≈øes and different opinions of Authours, I mean, as to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence it proceeds; for ≈øome will have it, that it is fed by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors which we drink, of which opinion is the Learned <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whence in his Book <hi>de Corde</hi> he ≈øaith, that the Heart dwelleth in a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becau≈øe of the re≈øemblance the Humour in the Heart-bag hath to that in the bladder of Urine; though at the ≈øame time he denies this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Humour to have any acrimony or bracki≈øhne≈øs, as the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bladder of Urine hath.</p>
                        <p>And to confirm this Opinion of his, that this Humour contained in the Heart-bag doth proceed from Liquors taken in at the Mouth, he cites an Experiment to be tried on a Pigg, (though I ≈øuppo≈øe any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ≈øerve as well) which after it is kept fa≈øting for ≈øome time ≈øhould have given it to drink Water or Milk mingled with Vermillion, and after
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57416:60"/>it hath drunk it, ≈øhould immediately be killed, and as ≈øoon after as po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible have his Wind-pipe opened, and al≈øo all or mo≈øt of its branches, in which, ≈øaith my Authour, you will find along all its in≈øide, the colour of the Liquor which it drank, even to the extremities or ends of the ≈ømalle≈øt Pipes; out of which Pipes (≈øaith he) part of it is di≈øtilled into the Heart-bag. I confe≈øs this is no very probable Opinion, but I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it for the great antiquity and fame of the Authour of it.</p>
                        <p>But other Authours are of opinions contrary to this, ≈øome ≈øaying that it proceeds from a moi≈øture, ≈ølaver or ≈øpittle, which di≈øtils out of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels under the Tongue into the Weazand, and from thence into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Heart, and ≈øo into the Heart-bag. But this is as improbable as the former.</p>
                        <p>A late Learned Authour thinks that it i≈ø≈øues out of certain Glands or Kernels ≈øeated at the ba≈øis of the Heart. And this is an Opinion that is ≈øomewhat likely, though I think the next is to be preferr'd before it.</p>
                        <p>La≈øtly, Others (among≈øt whom is <hi>Bartholin</hi>) <note place="margin">See <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> lib. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> conceive that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from moi≈øt Vapours and Exhalations forced out of the Humours of the Heart by the motion and heat thereof, which being ≈øtopt by the clo≈øene≈øs of the Heart-bag, are by its re≈øpective coldne≈øs congealed into Water.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Water or Humour is, in the fir≈øt place, to keep the Heart moi≈øt and cool; for the Heart being a very hot Part, requires ≈øomething of this nature to cool it, e≈øpecially if that be true which ≈øome report of the left Ventricle, that it hath been found in live Di≈ø≈øections ≈øo hot, as almo≈øt to ≈øcald the Di≈ø≈øector's finger which he put into it.</p>
                        <p>By this Humour the Heart al≈øo becometh more ea≈øy in its motion, for by it, it is as it were born or buoy'd up, ≈øo that it ≈øwimmeth in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby the ≈øen≈øe or feeling of the weight of it is taken away.</p>
                        <p> Such a Humour as this before-≈øpoken of is al≈øo found in the cavity of the Che≈øt, onely ≈øomething of a more ruddy colour, looking like Water and Bloud mingled together; and this I have never found wanting, but that there hath been ≈øome either little or much; with which moi≈øture the Parts of the Che≈øt are moi≈øtened and cooled, even as the Heart is by the moi≈øture contained in the Heart-bag.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Heart.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Heart a principal Part. From whence it derives its name Cor. Its ≈øituation. Why the Pul≈øe is felt on the left ≈øide and not the right. The motion of the Heart. The rea≈øon of the Pul≈øe. The figure of the Heart. Its ≈øub≈øtance. Its connexion. Its External Parts. Its Coat. Its Fat. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Fat of the Heart and other Fat. The External Ve≈ø≈øels of the Heart. One Vein. Two Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Their Valves. Nerves.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THERE is none can be ≈øo ignorant of the Parts of the Body, as not to know that the Heart is one of the <hi>principal</hi> Parts thereof: for as it is the fountain of the Vital faculty and power, it ought to be ≈øo ≈øtyled. It is al≈øo the place of natural heat, the root of the Arteries from whence they all ≈øpring. It is moreover the Authour of the Pul≈øe, and the fir≈øt Bowel living (as I ≈øhall more at large declare in the following Chapter) and the la≈øt dying.</p>
                        <p>It is called in Latine <hi>Cor, √† currendo</hi> from running, becau≈øe of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion.</p>
                        <p>It is onely one in number, <hi>≈øituated</hi> in the mid≈øt of the cavity of the Che≈øt, as well for its ≈øecurity, as for the equal ballancing of that part of the Body; in which place it is incompa≈ø≈øed by the Lobes of the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>Yet notwith≈øtanding the ≈øituation of it in the middle part of the Che≈øt, it is to be under≈øtood that not the whole Heart but onely the ba≈øis or root of it is directly in the middle; for the point of it leans toward the left ≈øide, by rea≈øon of the ≈ømallne≈øs of the compa≈øs it hath to perform its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in; for it would be apt to ≈øtrike again≈øt the Midriff, ≈øhould it not be ≈øo drawn to one ≈øide, which would not onely hinder its <hi>own</hi> motion, but al≈øo indanger the violating of the Midriff and hinder <hi>its</hi> motion; for <hi>it</hi> al≈øo is known to have a perpetual motion as well as the Heart.</p>
                        <p>And it is from the point of the Heart's inclining to the left ≈øide, that the motion of the Heart or its pul≈øe is ≈øo plain to be felt on that ≈øide: which not being equally to be felt on the right, many, who have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains of looking or in≈øpecting into Bodies to ≈øee the contrary, do conclude, that the Heart is ≈øituated altogether on the left ≈øide, and that it is not the point alone which they feel beat, but the whole Heart.</p>
                        <p>Another rea≈øon there is why it ≈øhould incline to the left ≈øide, namely, becau≈øe the a≈øcendent Trunk of <hi>Vena cava</hi> lieth on the right ≈øide, ≈øo that were the point not drawn ≈øomething to the other ≈øide, it would be apt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57416:61"/>to lie upon or ≈øtrike again≈øt that Ve≈ø≈øel, and ≈øo hinder the a≈øcent of the Bloud which is brought from the Liver by that Vein to the Heart.</p>
                        <p>The Heart has a double motion, Contraction called its <hi>≈øy≈øtole,</hi> and Relaxation called its <hi>dia≈øtole.</hi> (Though this latter may rather be deemed a cea≈øing from motion, than a motion.) While it is relaxed or becomes flaggy and loo≈øe, it receives the Bloud into its Ventricles out of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein and Lung-vein; out of the former into its right Ventricle, and out of the latter into its left. And when it contracts it ≈øelf, it expels or ≈øquirts out the Bloud out of its Ventricles into the Lung-artery and great Artery; out of the right Ventricle into the Lung-artery, and out of the left into the great Artery.</p>
                        <p>As to the pul≈øation or beating of the Heart, it is very difficult, if not impo≈ø≈øible to give any ≈øatisfactory rea≈øon of it. Some impute it to the flowing in of the Animal Spirits by the Nerves; others to the boiling and rarefaction of the Bloud in its Ventricles. 'Tis mo≈øt certain that the mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fibres of the Heart are the immediate in≈øtruments of its motion, and that the≈øe receive their power to move, from the Animal Spirits conveyed by the Nerves: but what it is that puts the≈øe Fibres upon ≈øuch a reciprocal motion of contraction and relaxation as the Heart ob≈øerves, is the greate≈øt difficulty to determine. The greate≈øt Anatomi≈øts have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt their ignorance in this point: I ≈øhall not therefore pretend to give a rea≈øon of it, but admire the wi≈øedom of the great Creator in framing ≈øuch an Engine, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for the conveying life, heat and nouri≈øhment to all the Parts of the Body. Waving this then, I ≈øhall proceed to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther de≈øcription of the Heart.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of the Heart is pyramidal or conick, that is, it is broad at the ba≈øis or bottom, and narrow at its ≈øummity or top. On the fore-≈øide it is bo≈ø≈øy or bunching, but on the hinder ≈øide more flat. It is ≈øometimes longer and ≈øometimes ≈øhorter, as thus: When in its motion it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted (at which time it pours out the Bloud) then is it ≈øhorter, but broader; and again when it is dilated, at which time it receives in the Bloud, then is it longer and narrower.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> is a ≈øolid, thick and compact fle≈øh, that it might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indure the perpetuity of the motion, and with more force drive the Bloud into the extreme or farthe≈øt Parts of the Body. It con≈øi≈øteth mo≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of mu≈øculary or fle≈øhy Fibres, a few of which run ≈øtreight and are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, but the far greate≈øt part run ≈ølanting or rather ≈øpiral-wi≈øe, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards its point, re≈øembling ≈øomewhat the winding-rings of a Snail's ≈øhell.</p>
                        <p>It is tied by the mediation of the Heart-bag to the <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> and by its own Ve≈ø≈øels to ≈øeveral Parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Its Parts are ≈øome <hi>External</hi> and ≈øome <hi>Internal.</hi> Tho≈øe which be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> or outward, are the Pur≈øe, the Coat, and the Fat; to which may be added ≈øome of its Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Pur≈øe</hi> or Heart-bag, we have treated of it in the foregoing Chapter. As to the <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> ≈øome of them encompa≈øs the Heart, as the Coronary Vein and Arteries; others reach into its Entrances and into the Ventricles, and tho≈øe are the A≈øcendent and De≈øcendent Trunks of the hollow Vein and Great Artery, al≈øo the Pulmonary Ve≈ø≈øels. Of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries we ≈øhall ≈øpeak by and by in this Chapter; but of the re≈øt, in the next.</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57416:62"/>
                        <p>It hath a <hi>Coat</hi> proper to it ≈øelf, like the Coat of a Mu≈øcle, for its grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter firmne≈øs, which Coat ≈øticks ≈øo clo≈øe to it, that it is hard to be ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or removed from it. It is the ≈øame with the outer Coat of the Great Artery, as that Skin which cloaths the in≈øide of its Ventricles is continued unto and con≈øtitutes the inmo≈øt Membrane of that Artery.</p>
                        <p>The Heart becau≈øe of its continual motion and great heat, is plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtored with <hi>Fat,</hi> to keep it from being over-dried, which Fat is mo≈øt of it placed at the ba≈øis or bottom of it; for its point hanging in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained in the Heart-bag is continually moi≈øtned with that, ≈øo that it ≈øtands not in need of being moi≈øtned or cooled any other way.</p>
                        <p>Yet thus much notice is to be taken, as to this Fat which grows to the Heart, that it differs in con≈øi≈øtence from all or mo≈øt of the other Fat of the whole Body, as being much harder: for ≈øhould the Heart, which is a very hot Part, have any ≈øuch ≈øoft Fat near it, it would certainly melt it. And as the Fat which grows or ≈øticks to the remoter Parts of the Body differs from this in nature, ≈øo hath it al≈øo a name different from this; for the former is called <hi>pimele,</hi> which ≈øignifies a kind of grea≈øie Fat; but the latter is called <hi>Adeps,</hi> which is to ≈øay Tallow, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as hard as Tallow, differing much from <hi>pimele</hi> or Grea≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of the Heart, and of the≈øe it is furni≈øhed with all ≈øorts; ≈øome of which do compa≈øs it round about at its ba≈øis, like a Garland, which are one Vein and two Arteries.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Vein,</hi> from its encompa≈ø≈øing or encircling it round, is called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronaria,</hi> or the Crown-vein, which Vein ari≈øes from the Trunk of the hollow Vein a little before its entrance into the right Earlet of the Heart. Small branches do ≈øpring from this Coronary Vein, and are di≈øper≈øed or ≈øprinkled all down the ≈øurface or out≈øide of the Heart from the ba≈øis to the point.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Arteries</hi> are in number two, which are al≈øo called <hi>Coronariae</hi> or Crown-arteries, from their encircling the Heart as the Vein does, where like it they di≈øper≈øe ≈ømall branches about all the external ≈øurface of the Heart, furni≈øhing it with arterial Bloud for its life and nouri≈øhment.</p>
                        <p>There is ob≈øerved at the original of each of the≈øe Arteries, as is likewi≈øe in the Vein, a certain <hi>Valve</hi> which is to be ≈øeen if you di≈ø≈øect either Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, opening it a little before it pa≈ø≈øeth out of the Heart-bag; which Valve or Floud-gate in the Vein lets the Bloud into the Heart, but ≈øuffers none to come out again that way; and in the Artery it permits the Bloud to i≈ø≈øue out of the Heart, but will let none return back out of it into the Heart.</p>
                        <p>The Heart is al≈øo furni≈øhed with very many but very ≈ømall <hi>Nerves,</hi> ≈øpringing from branches of the eighth pair, which branches are tho≈øe that are ≈øent to the Heart-bag.</p>
                        <p>They branch into and enter the Heart in three ≈øeveral places; fir≈øt, one enters into the Heart it ≈øelf, another into the Earlets of the Heart, and a third into its Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of the Parts of the Heart which in ≈øome regard may be called <hi>External;</hi> in the next Chapter we ≈øhall proceed to tho≈øe that are more <hi>Internal.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Ventricles, internal Ve≈ø≈øels, Valves and Earlets of the Heart.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The right Ventricle. Its figure. Its ≈øub≈øtance. Its u≈øe. Why Fi≈øh have but one Ventricle. The left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle. Its largene≈øs. Its figure. Its ≈øides are thicker, and harder than tho≈øe of the right. Its u≈øe. The in≈øides of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The ≈øeptum. Its pores. The internal Ve≈ø≈øels of the Heart. Vena cava and vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio≈øa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; Arteria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øa and Aorta to the left. Three Valves to the Vena cava, called tricu≈øpides. Three al≈øo to the vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio≈øa, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ≈øigmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deae. Two to the Arteria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øa, called mitrales. Three to the Aorta, called ≈øemilunares. The auriculae of the Heart. Their ≈øurface. Their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance. Their motion. Their u≈øe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE will fir≈øt ≈øpeak of the Ventricles or <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in number two, on each ≈øide one, di≈øtingui≈øhed or divided by a fle≈øhy partition into a right and a left.</p>
                        <p>The right (called the right <hi>Sinus</hi> or Ventricle, and by ≈øome the Cave or Chamber) is ≈øomewhat bigger than the left, becau≈øe it receives as well that Bloud which is ≈øpent upon the nouri≈øhment of the Lungs, through which the Bloud pa≈ø≈øes from this Ventricle to the left, as that which actually is conveyed into the left, and from thence ≈øent forth by the Arteries into all parts of the Body. But its larger capacity is onely in re≈øpect of its width, for the left is rather longer than it, as reaching nearer the tip of the Heart.</p>
                        <p>It is in <hi>figure</hi> not exactly round, but rather ≈øemicircular, or half-moon fa≈øhioned.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> of its ≈øides is not ≈øo hard and thick as is that of the left,nor is the ≈øurface of its inner cavity ≈øo uneven; nor has it ≈øo many and ≈øo ≈øtrong fle≈øhy Fibres reaching this way and that way, as the left hath. For it was not nece≈ø≈øary it ≈øhould be of ≈øo ≈øtrong a compo≈øure as the left, ≈øeeing neither is the Bloud rarefied ≈øo much in it, nor does it ≈øend the Bloud out of it to any greater di≈øtance than the Lungs, whereas the left pours it into the remote≈øt Parts of the Body, and therefore requires a ≈øtronger con≈øtitution to ≈øquirt it out.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Ventricle is fir≈øt to receive the Bloud out of the hollow Vein returning from the circulation, as al≈øo the Chyle and <hi>Lympha</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the Bloud, out of the axillar Vein, and then to attenuate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct and in≈øpirit them for the nouri≈øhment of the Lungs, to which they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57416:64"/>are carried under the form of Bloud by the Pulmonary Artery, otherwi≈øe called the Arterial vein. But it is but a very ≈ømall portion of the Bloud that is ≈øpent upon the Lungs, the greate≈øt part of it pa≈ø≈øing by the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Vein to the left Ventricle, there to receive a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>Now it is worth ob≈øervation in this place, that ≈øuch Creatures as live in the Water, as Fi≈øh in general, which have no Lungs, have but one Ventricle in their Heart. For the rea≈øon why Animals that live upon the Land have two Ventricles, being, that the Bloud as it pa≈ø≈øes from one to the other, ≈øhould be conveyed through the Lungs, there to be ventilated and cooled by the Air drawn in in in≈øpiration; and ≈øeeing Fi≈øh live in a cold Element, <hi>viz.</hi> the Water, which encompa≈ø≈øes their whole Body, <hi>that,</hi> of it ≈øelf, is ≈øufficient to attemper the heat of the Bloud; therefore as it is impo≈ø≈øible they ≈øhould make any u≈øe of Lungs in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ≈øo there ≈øeems to be no need of them, nor con≈øequently of two Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles in the Heart, which are nece≈ø≈øary for Land-animals that have Lungs, and breathe in the free Air. How far Water approaches to the nature of Air, or whether there be any truly airy particles contained in the pores of the Water; and if there be, whether there be any way ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable whereby they can in≈øinuate them≈øelves into the Bloud and Hearts of Fi≈øhes, are Points too nice and philo≈øophical for me to intermeddle with. But ≈øeeing Fi≈øh can live ≈øo brisk for very many years without re≈øpiration (at lea≈øt properly ≈øo called, or that we can conceive of) one would ≈øu≈øpect that ≈øome of our late Anatomi≈øts attribute too much virtue to the Air that we breathe in, as if it were <hi>the All</hi> that continues the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal flame as they ≈øpeak, and that the Vital heat and ≈øpirit are no otherwi≈øe owing to the Heart, than as like an Engine it keeps the Bloud in motion, and di≈øtributes it with the Spirits into all Parts of the Body by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. But this by the bye.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the <hi>left</hi> Ventricle, which in magnitude doth not equal the former, it being much le≈øs, by rea≈øon it is to contain a le≈øs quantity of Bloud than the right Ventricle doth, part of that Bloud that comes out of the right, being ≈øpent upon the nouri≈øhment of the Lungs, before it reaches the left.</p>
                        <p>This left Ventricle differs al≈øo in <hi>figure</hi> from the right: for as the right is ob≈øerved to be ≈øemicircular, the left is almo≈øt round and longer, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almo≈øt down to the point of the Heart, which the other doth not.</p>
                        <p>Likewi≈øe the fle≈øh or <hi>wall</hi> of the left is much <hi>thicker</hi> than that of the other, and that partly becau≈øe of the ≈ømallne≈øs of the cavity, which the narrower it is, mu≈øt needs leave the ≈øides ≈øo much the thicker. Onely the left ≈øide of this Ventricle near the lower end or tip of the Heart, is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than any part of the ≈øides of the right.</p>
                        <p>Al≈øo it is <hi>harder</hi> and more compact than the other, that the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits might not exhale or evaporate, and that its con≈øtriction might be the ≈øtronger, ≈øo that the Bloud might with more force be thrown or pul≈øt out and vented into the farthe≈øt parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Into this Ventricle is the Bloud received out of the Lungs by the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Vein (otherwi≈øe called the veinous Artery.) Which Bloud when it is ≈øquirted out of this Ventricle into the great Artery, differs very much in colour from that which i≈ø≈øues out of the right Ventricle into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Artery: for this latter is of a dark purple colour, but the former of a florid ≈øcarlet. But mo≈øt think that this alteration of colour is not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57416:64"/>≈øo much owing to any ≈øupereminent virtue in this Ventricle above the right, as to the particles of Air that in≈øinuate them≈øelves into the Bloud in the Lungs whiles it pa≈ø≈øes out of the Pulmonary Artery into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Vein; for Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> affirmeth, that if in Live-di≈ø≈øections one open the Pulmonary Vein in its pa≈ø≈øage from the Lungs to the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the Bloud will appear to be of the ≈øame ≈øcarlet colour as when it comes out of the ≈øaid Ventricle. Suppo≈øing this to be ≈øo (which I think we may do upon the te≈øtimony of ≈øo worthy and creditable an Authour) yet it cannot be denied but that the airy particles mu≈øt be more intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with the Bloud by the great agitation it receives in the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, ≈øo that we may ≈øtill con≈øent to the Ancients, that Vital Spirits (in which, Air ≈øeems to be a main Ingredient) are perfected and rectified to their height (as it were) in it more than in the right. The u≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the left Ventricle is to perfect the Vital Spirits, and to tran≈ømit them, together with the Bloud, by the Arteries over all the Body, for the pre≈øervation of the Vital heat, and for the nouri≈øhment of each Part.</p>
                        <p>The in≈øides of both the Ventricles are unequal or uneven and rugged,being hollowed into many furrows di≈øtingui≈øhed by fle≈øhy Fibres, that the Bloud which comes into the Heart might be the more agitated in them, and thereby more intimately mixed with the Chyle and Air that come along with it, the fir≈øt into the right Ventricle, and both into the left. From the≈øe fle≈øhy Fibres are nervous ones extended to the Valves, of which we ≈øhall di≈øcour≈øe by and by. They are more numerous and ≈øtronger in the left Ventricle than in the right, becau≈øe a ≈øtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtriction was nece≈ø≈øary for the former than for the latter, ≈øeeing from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bloud is ≈øent to all Parts of the Body, but from the latter to no greater di≈øtance than the Lungs, as was ob≈øerved before. The≈øe Fibres, Furrows and Valves you may ≈øee very well expre≈øt in the following Figure.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Ventricles are divided by a Wall called the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> or partition,which is nothing el≈øe but the right wall of the left Ventricle; wherefore its right ≈øide is bunched, but the left hollow. On its left ≈øide it is furrowed and unequal as the re≈øt of the Ventricle is, but on the right it is well nigh ≈ømooth. It is a very ancient opinion, that there are a great many large pores or holes in this <hi>≈øeptum,</hi> whereby the thinne≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øpirituous part of the Bloud pa≈ø≈øes out of the right Ventricle into the left immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, without taking that circuit through the Lungs that the re≈øt doth. They are ≈øaid to be wider on its right ≈øide, and going ≈ølanting to grow narrower towards the left. There are many Modern as well as Ancient Vouchers of this opinion: among≈øt whom is <hi>Bartholin,</hi> who having enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated ≈øeveral Anatomi≈øts that have affirmed to have ≈øeen them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, ≈øays that he him≈øelf has ≈øeen the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> of a Hog's Heart ≈ølantingly pervious in ≈øeveral places with great and manife≈øt pores, ≈øo large as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a pretty big Pea≈øe, and lying open without a Probe, which being put into any one of them on the right ≈øide pa≈ø≈øed to the left Ventricle, where a thin Membrane did hang before the mouth of the Pore like an Ana≈øtomo≈øis (as he calls it, I ≈øuppo≈øe he means a Valve) which hindred the putting in the Probe on that ≈øide, and con≈øequently mu≈øt have hindred the return of the Bloud out of the left Ventricle into the right when the Animal was living. And he thinks that the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> is nouri≈øhed by the Bloud that pa≈ø≈øes through the≈øe Pores, ≈øeeing the Coronary Veins (above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øcribed) run onely through the ≈øurface or out≈øide of the Heart. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57416:65"/>he will have not onely the more ≈øpirituous part of the Bloud, but the thinner part of the Chyle al≈øo to pa≈øs through them. It would be <hi>tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to recite all tho≈øe Authours that he quotes to ≈øecond him, as al≈øo his Apology for their often not-appearing in many dead Bodies, ≈øeeing there are many pa≈ø≈øages be≈øides the≈øe in Live-creatures, that there are no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteps of after they are dead: for as it ≈øeems not likely that the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> ≈øhould be nouri≈øhed by bloud that pa≈ø≈øes ≈øo rapidly through the≈øe ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed holes; ≈øo by the carefulle≈øt examination of other skilfull Anatomi≈øts there have been no ≈øuch holes to be found, unle≈øs they were fir≈øt made by the Probe; though indeed there are ≈øeveral pits that look as if they went through, which I believe to be onely framed for the greater agitation of the bloud in the Ventricle.</p>
                        <p>In the foregoing Chapter we de≈øcribed tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels that may be called <hi>external</hi> from their running chiefly on the out≈øide of the Heart,(com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly named the Coronary) by which it is nouri≈øhed: but there are another ≈øort that may be termed <hi>internal,</hi> which are ≈øuch as open into and out of its Ventricles or inward <hi>Sinus's,</hi> but yield no nouri≈øhment to it. The≈øe are four, the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and pulmonary Artery; the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vein, and great Artery.</p>
                        <p>Of the≈øe, the <hi>Vena cava</hi> or hollow Vein, and the <hi>Vena Arterio≈øa</hi> or pulmonary Artery do belong to the right Ventricle; the hollow Vein fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with venal bloud returning from all Parts of the Body, which it receives in when the Heart is relaxed, which ≈øtate is called its <hi>dia≈øtole;</hi> and the pulmonary Artery carrying forth the ≈øaid bloud into the Lungs when the Heart is contracted, which ≈øtate of the Heart is called its <hi>≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtole.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the left Ventricle do al≈øo belong two Ve≈ø≈øels, namely, <hi>Arteria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øa</hi> or the pulmonary Vein, and <hi>Aorta</hi> or the great Artery. The pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vein within the ≈øub≈øtance of the Lungs doth receive the bloud from the pulmonary Artery, and pours it into the left Ventricle, there to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ventilate the vital flame, and to perfect the arterial bloud and ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The great Artery is the trunk from which all other Arteries do branch, and through which the arterial bloud (after it is in this Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle perfected as afore≈øaid) is di≈øper≈øed or thrown into all the Parts of the Body, for the life and nouri≈øhment thereof.</p>
                        <p>Now to each of the≈øe four Ve≈ø≈øels do belong <hi>Valves,</hi> for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their offices before ≈øpoken of. And fir≈øt to the hollow Vein do belong three, which are of a triangular figure, and are from that ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure called <hi>treble-pointed</hi> Valves. They are placed at the ba≈øis or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Heart at the entrance of the ≈øaid Vein into the Heart, and do look from without inward, that ≈øo they may admit of the bloud's pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing through them into the Heart, but ≈øuffer none to pa≈øs out again that way.</p>
                        <p>To the pulmonary Artery do al≈øo belong three Valves, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, look from within outward, and from the re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they have with the letter C, are called <hi>Sigma</hi>-fa≈øhioned, the old Greek <hi>Sigma</hi> being of that ≈øhape. The≈øe Valves as the former are placed at the ba≈øis of the Heart, and at the entrance or rather outlet of the Ventricle. And their u≈øe is, to let the bloud, brought into this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle by the hollow Vein, pa≈øs again out of the ≈øaid Ventricle into the pulmonary Artery, to be carried by it into the Lungs; but they will not admit of any bloud to return from the Lungs into it.</p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57416:65"/>
                        <p>To the pulmonary Vein do belong two Valves, which look from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward, as the treble-pointed Valves do, and their u≈øe is to admit of the bloud brought out of the Lungs by the pulmonary Vein, into the left Ventricle, but they will ≈øuffer none to pa≈øs by that Vein back to the Lungs again. The≈øe, from the re≈øemblance they are ≈øaid to have with a Bi≈øhop's Mitre, are called Mitre-≈øhaped Valves.</p>
                        <p>To the <hi>Arteria magna</hi> or great Artery do al≈øo belong three Valves,which go by the name of Semilunary or Half-moon-fa≈øhioned Valves. Their u≈øe is to hinder any bloud from returning into the left Ventricle out of the great Artery; but they permit the Bloud to pa≈øs by them out of the Heart into the ≈øaid Artery, from whence it is ≈øent by its ≈øeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into all the Parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Having ≈øpoken to the Ventricles, Ve≈ø≈øels and Valves of the Heart, we are in the next place come to treat of the two Appendices or Proce≈ø≈øes which are placed at the bottom or ba≈øis of it, and are called the <hi>Ears</hi> or <hi>Earlets</hi> of the Heart, from ≈øome re≈øemblance in ≈øhape which they have to the Ears of the Head. They are in number two, to each ≈øide of the Heart one, an≈øwerable to the number of the Ventricles. Of the≈øe, the right is larger, but ≈øofter; the left le≈ø≈øer, but harder. The right is larger, becau≈øe the orifice of the hollow Vein belonging to the right Ventricle, is much bigger and larger than the orifice of the pulmonary Vein belonging to the left Ventricle. For it was not needfull that the Lung-vein ≈øhould be ≈øo large as the hollow Vein, ≈øeeing the bloud that it conducts to the left Ventricle is neither ≈øo much as that which is brought by the <hi>cava</hi> to the right, and be≈øides is thinner and more ≈øpirituous being impregnated with Air in the Lungs, and therefore pa≈ø≈øing more quickly needs the narrower channel.</p>
                        <p>The external part or <hi>≈øurface</hi> of them, when full or extended, is ≈ømooth and bunching; but when empty, wrinkled.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> is peculiar, ≈øuch as is to be found in no other part,thin and ≈øoft that they might be the ea≈øilier contracted, and yet nervous and ≈øtrong, that they might endure that continual motion to which they are de≈øtin'd. Of the two, the left is the more compact, thick and fle≈øhy. On their in≈øide they have Fibres running from their ba≈øis where they are joined to the Heart, towards their top where the Veins enter them, (≈øuch as the Ventricles of the Heart them≈øelves have) by help whereof they contract them≈øelves in their <hi>≈øy≈øtole,</hi> and ≈øqueeze the bloud contained in them, into the Ventricles.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Ears or Earlets have (as the Heart it ≈øelf hath) two motions,fir≈øt the <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> or contractive, next the <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> or dilative motion. There is al≈øo betwixt the≈øe two motions (both in the Ears and Heart) a re≈øt or pau≈øe, ea≈øy to be di≈øcerned in ≈øick Hor≈øes, or Hor≈øes ready to die, but not ≈øo ea≈øy to be either di≈øcerned or felt in a ≈øound or healthfull Hor≈øe; for in ≈øuch, the motions are performed ≈øo ≈øwiftly, that there ≈øeems to be an immediate pa≈ø≈øage from one to the other, without any intermi≈ø≈øion or re≈øting between. This pau≈øe or re≈øt between the two motions, is called <hi>peri≈øy≈øtole.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> and <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> of both Earlets do happen at one and the ≈øame time; for when the right undergoes its <hi>dia≈øtole,</hi> then and at the very ≈øame in≈øtant the left undergoes the ≈øame. And they do the like in the <hi>≈øy≈øtole.</hi> But though the Heart hath the ≈øame motions as the≈øe Earlets have, yet it doth not perform them when the≈øe do; for the <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> of the Earlets happens at the ≈øame time with the <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> of the Ventricles; and on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57416:66"/>the contrary, the <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> of the Ventricles, with the <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> of the Earlets.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe Ears or Earlets is, to prevent the too violent ru≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the bloud out of the <hi>Cava</hi> and Lung-vein into the Ventricles of the Heart, whereby both the Valves might have been violated, and the Vital faculty ≈øuffocated. For the≈øe receiving the bloud out of the ≈øaid Veins, do mea≈øure it as it were into the Heart, ≈øo much bloud di≈øtilling out of tho≈øe Veins into the≈øe Earlets in each of their <hi>dia≈øtole's,</hi> as can be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently rarefied and elaborated at one time in the Ventricles.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Lungs,</hi> which are the chief In≈øtruments of breathing or re≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,are called in Latin <hi>Pulmones,</hi> in Greek <hi>Pneumones,</hi> from their office of drawing in and blowing out the Breath or Air.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>≈øituation</hi> is in the cavity or hollowne≈øs of the Che≈øt, which cavity they almo≈øt fill up; e≈øpecially when they are di≈øtended or filled with wind. They are divided into two equal parts called <hi>Lobes,</hi> one of which lies on the right ≈øide of the <hi>Media≈øtinum,</hi> or Partition-membrane of the Che≈øt, and the other on the left.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> hath hitherto been taken to be a <hi>parenchyma</hi> or fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance; but by the diligent ≈øearching into Nature of ≈øome of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, e≈øpecially of an Italian named <hi>Malpighius,</hi> they have been found of a contrary ≈øub≈øtance; for he affirms them to be excarnous or without fle≈øh, and merely membranous, made up of the branches of the Wind-pipe and little bladders at the ends of them, likewi≈øe of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Ve≈ø≈øels, and the Skin that cloaths them. But the greate≈øt part of their ≈øub≈øtance con≈øi≈øts of the little bladders.</p>
                        <p>This that worthy Man experienced by ca≈øting Water into the Lungs of ≈øome Creatures he di≈ø≈øected, while they were yet warm, ≈øo often till the whole frame of the Lungs appeared white; then ≈øqueezing the water clean out, he with a pair of Bellows or Pipe filled them by the Wind-pipe full of Air, and pent it in by tying the Windpipe; which done, he hung them up to dry; and when they were dried, he could di≈øcover (by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to the light) the little bladders at the ends of each little branch of the Wind-pipe, as they are lively repre≈øented in Figures by that great Inquirer into Nature, the never to be forgotten Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>See</hi> Willis <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>of his</hi> Pharmaceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis.</note> ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtyled the honour of his Univer≈øity and Country, in the ≈øecond Part of his Book called <hi>Pharmaceutice rationalis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, ≈øaith the forementioned <hi>Malpighius,</hi> If you cut any part of the Lungs thus dried, you may very plainly ≈øee a great number of the≈øe bladders looking white. Moreover he affirms that by the help of a Micro≈øcope he could di≈øcern a certain wonderfull Net as it were, tying all the≈øe bladders to one another, which he conceived to be made up of the ≈ømall branchings of the pulmonary Artery and Vein, which Ve≈ø≈øels convey the bloud through
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57416:68"/>the ≈ølender and winding ducts, and through the manifold bendings of the Pipes. And be≈øides the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which make this Net, Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> ≈øaith that there are another ≈øort to be perceived in living Di≈ø≈øections, which are called <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> and are di≈øper≈øed all over the Lungs. Of what nature and u≈øe the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels are, we have ≈øhewn above in the Fir≈øt Book, chap. 12. and ≈øhall do further by and by. And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> he ≈øays there are abundance of twigs of <hi>Nerves</hi> di≈øtributed every-where through them. Onely one thing further is to be noted concerning the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Lungs from the ≈øaid Doctor's ob≈øervation, that the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not onely branches of the pulmonary Artery and Vein, but al≈øo ≈øome proceed from the <hi>Aorta</hi> it ≈øelf; which ≈øhould ≈øeem to intimate that the Lungs are truly nouri≈øhed by the≈øe la≈øt, as are all other Parts of the Body, and that the bloud that comes to the Lungs from the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart by the pulmonary Artery, and returns to the left by the pulmonary Vein, pa≈ø≈øes not this way for the nouri≈øhment of the Lungs, but onely that it may be impregnated with Air, without which as it wants of its perfection, ≈øo is it unfit and unable to pre≈øerve the vital heat of any Part, or to contribute any nouri≈øhment to it. But this onely by the bye.</p>

                        <p>Now the ≈øeveral things here named, of which the Lungs are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed or framed, do plainly ≈øhew their ≈øub≈øtance is not carnous or fle≈øhy, but merely fi≈øtulous, being compacted of Pipes of ≈øeveral kinds and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and variou≈øly and intricately di≈øpo≈øed; which Pipes we will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ≈øpeak to in order, and fir≈øt of the chief of them, which is the Wind-pipe, called <hi>A≈øpera Arteria</hi> the rough Artery.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>A≈øpera Arteria</hi> is a Pipe or Chanel which de≈øcends down the Neck beginning in the Throat at the root of the Tongue, and reaches as far as the Lungs, in which it di≈øper≈øes it ≈øelf into innumerable branches great and ≈ømall, which branches reach to all the extreme parts of their
<pb facs="tcp:57416:69"/>
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57416:69"/>≈øub≈øtance, and at la≈øt end in little bladders, each of them in re≈øemblance like a Grape, into which they conveigh the Air in in≈øpiration. The≈øe Grape-like Bladders are lively repre≈øented by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Willis <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceut. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Part. 2. ≈øect. 1. cap. 1.</note> in a Lobe of the Lungs of an Ox, as you may ≈øee in the fir≈øt Figure of the third Table in his ≈øecond Part of the operation of Medicines; of which bladders you may there reade more at large.</p>
                        <p> The fore-mentioned Wind-pipe is by Anatomi≈øts divided into three principal parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Larynx</hi> or Throttle, which is the upper end of it (of which more afterwards.) The ≈øecond part between the <hi>Larynx</hi> and the Lungs, being a long Pipe, is called particularly <hi>Trachea</hi> or <hi>a≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria,</hi> the rough Artery; <hi>rough,</hi> to di≈øtingui≈øh it from the <hi>≈ømooth</hi> Arteries which contain the bloud and vital ≈øpirits; and an <hi>Artery,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it <hi>keeps</hi> or contains <hi>the Air</hi> in re≈øpiration. The la≈øt part of the Wind-pipe is di≈øtingui≈øh'd by the name of <hi>bronchus</hi> or <hi>bronchia,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ramifications or branchings of it in the Lungs; though the name <hi>bronchus</hi> is ≈øometimes u≈øed to ≈øignify all of it.</p>
                        <p> Now before we pa≈øs on further to the de≈øcription of this Wind-pipe, it will not be ami≈øs to examine whether any part of the Liquors that an Hor≈øe drinks pa≈øs along it, or whether all go down the Gullet. That <hi>part</hi> of the drink glides down the Weazand was the opinion of the Ancient Phy≈øician <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who experienced the ≈øame in an Hog newly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in who≈øe Lungs was found a quantity of Liquor of the ≈øame colour with that which the Hog had drunk a little before. And <hi>Bartholin</hi> thinks that the ≈øame thing may be proved from an ob≈øervation of <hi>Julius Ja≈øolin</hi> an Anatomi≈øt of the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> who ≈øeeking in the Body of a Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon the cau≈øe of his death, found his Heart-bag ≈øo filled with humour, that it being ≈øqueezed, ≈øome of the ≈øaid humour came out of his Mouth. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is an odd inference to conclude from hence, that therefore ≈øome part of the drink u≈øually pa≈ø≈øes down the Wind-pipe. For if one ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe that it did ≈øo pa≈øs, it cannot ea≈øily be imagined by what ways it could pa≈øs from thence to the Heart-bag; ≈øeeing all the branches of the Wind-pipe end in the Lungs, which are covered with a Membrane that never adheres to the Heart-bag, and very rarely if ever to the <hi>Media≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> that comes between the Heart-bag and the Lungs. 'Tis true it ≈øeems ≈øomewhat ≈øtrange, that upon pre≈ø≈øing the Heart-bag, the liquor contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it ≈øhould come up at the Mouth; but if the matter of fact be true, it mu≈øt do ≈øo by ≈øome preternatural pa≈ø≈øage, ≈øeeing every one that is skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Anatomy knows, that there is no communication between the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium</hi> and <hi>a≈øpera Arteria.</hi> Indeed as to the great quantity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Heart-bag, I have ob≈øerved the ≈øame in Hor≈øes, in which I have ≈øeen both it and the Che≈øt extremely filled with liquor, but I dare not conclude from thence, that it came thither down the Wind-pipe; for ≈øeeing it has been onely in di≈øea≈øed Hor≈øes, that have been broken-winded and troubled with coughs, I am much rather inclined to think, that ≈øo great quantity of water proceeded from a Drop≈øie of the Che≈øt, which is a di≈øea≈øe not unfrequent in Mankind, in whom yet the be≈øt Anatomi≈øts deny that the lea≈øt drop of drink does naturally pa≈øs down their Wind-pipe: of which any one may be pretty well ≈øatisfied, that has ob≈øerved in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf or others, how when upon occa≈øion of laughing or the like in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, any of the drink pa≈ø≈øes down the wrong Throat as we ≈øay (which is down the Wind-pipe) the party falls pre≈øently into a mo≈øt violent cough. And as to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s ob≈øervation, 'tis more likely the Hog's Lungs ≈øhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57416:70"/>be tinctured by ≈øome preternatural and di≈øea≈øed humour lodged in them, of a like colour to which his drink happened to be, than that they were tinctured by the drink it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p> The Wind-pipe is covered with two coats or skins, one <hi>outward</hi> and the other <hi>inward.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>outwardmo≈øt</hi> is but of a rea≈øonable thickne≈øs, neither ≈øo thick nor ≈øo ≈øtrong as the other. It ≈øprings from the <hi>pleura</hi> or skin which inve≈øts the Ribs, and ≈øticks clo≈øe to the Ligaments of the Gri≈øtles, yea does it ≈øelf ≈øerve to knit them more firmly one to another, and is a mean of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting the whole Pipe more ≈øtrongly to its neighbouring Parts. It al≈øo u≈øhers along the Nerves of the Wind-pipe and Lungs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>innermo≈øt</hi> is thicker and more ≈øolid than the former, in the Throttle e≈øpecially, who≈øe in≈øide it covers, as al≈øo all the in≈øide of the Wind-pipe and its branches from thence to the bottom of the Lungs. It has two rows of Mu≈øcular Fibres, the outer ≈øtreight, the inner ≈ølanting; the fir≈øt ≈øerving to ≈øhorten the Wind-pipe, the latter to ≈øtraiten it. And one rea≈øon of the great ≈øtrength of this Membrane ≈øeems to be, that it might the better endure the violent motion of coughing without being injured. It is very ≈øen≈øible, and has its in≈øide be≈ømear'd u≈øually with a fatti≈øh or ≈ølimy humour, which likely is ≈øeparated in the Kernels of the Throat, and this ≈øerves to keep it moi≈øt and glib, that re≈øpiration may be performed with the greater ea≈øine≈øs and freedom.</p>
                        <p> Between the≈øe two coats or skins is the body or ≈øub≈øtance of the Wind-pipe,being partly of the nature of a Gri≈øtle and partly of a Ligament; for it is made up of many round <hi>Gri≈øtles</hi> like Rings, being pretty round on its fore-part, but on the back-part which is next to the Gullet a fourth part of the circle is wanting, in the room of which there is a thick, ≈øtrong and membranous ≈øub≈øtance, more ≈øoft than the Gri≈øtles, that the Gullet which lies upon it on that ≈øide, might not be hurt by them.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Ring-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtles are joined together by ≈øtrong Ligaments, which Ligaments do every-where keep the Gri≈øtles at an equal di≈øtance one from the other.</p>

                        <p>The next u≈øe of it is to let the Air out from the Lungs, and together with it ≈ømoaky vapours ≈øteaming through the pores of the Lungs out of the bloud. By help of it al≈øo, but e≈øpecially of the Throttle or upper part, does the Hor≈øe neigh, or whinney as they call it in ≈øome Countrys, while the Air is driven forcibly out of it in expiration. And thus much as to the Wind-pipe.</p>
                        <p> A ≈øecond ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øel or Pipe di≈øper≈øed through the Lungs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing a con≈øiderable part of their bulk, are the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels, which are partly a branch from the great Artery, but principally the pulmona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Artery and Vein, who≈øe branches are ≈øpread to and fro in a great number through its whole ≈øub≈øtance, and there complicated and twi≈øted with the branches of the Wind-pipe, the Artery running along the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øide and the Vein the upper ≈øide of it, both cleaving ≈øo clo≈øe to it that they are not ea≈øily to be ≈øeparated. The≈øe Arteries and Veins have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication one with another in ≈øeveral places by <hi>ana≈øtomo≈øes,</hi> the little twigs of the Arteries opening into tho≈øe of the Veins, for the readier cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the bloud through the Lungs. Mo≈øt admirable is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels about the Air-bladders; for their ≈ømall thred-like twigs are interwoven one with another with the mo≈øt curious artifice (≈øomewhat re≈øembling a Net) round about all of them; which mo≈øt probably is ≈øo done, to the end that all the particles of the bloud may be impregnated with Air, while it pa≈ø≈øes through the≈øe fine Ve≈ø≈øels that twine about the Air-bladders on all hands.</p>

                        <p> A third ≈øort of Ve≈ø≈øel branching in the Lungs are the <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> ≈øo called from their office, which is to hold and convey a certain kind of water or humour called <hi>Lympha.</hi> The≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels we de≈øcribed more fully in Book I. chap. 12. Here they wait on the Veins and Arteries through the whole ≈øurface of the Lungs, and receive the humour or water that they contain from them, being fir≈øt ≈øeparated by the Glands; which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ≈øeems to be a ≈øuperfluity of the bloud and it may be the nervous juice, which after they have received, they di≈øcharge into the thoracick duct, into which the greater branches of them are in≈øerted. Though the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels be but ≈ølender, yet they are of great u≈øe and nece≈ø≈øity; for as Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> affirms, if at any time any of the branches of them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ob≈øtructed or broken, there follows thereupon in Man a Drop≈øie of the Lungs and Brea≈øt, oft-times accompanied with Coughs or Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicks: and this happens, becau≈øe by their being ob≈øtructed or broken, the ≈øuperfluous humour which they like ≈øo many chanels u≈øe to contain or let pa≈øs through them and carry off, is left behind, or di≈øtils into the Che≈øt, which there breeds the ≈øore-mentioned Di≈øtempers. Which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his confirms me in my belief of the original of that watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in a Hor≈øe, which I have very often in a plentifull manner found in his <hi>Thorax</hi> in di≈ø≈øection, as I have above in this Chapter already ≈øaid.</p>
                        <p> To the≈øe three ≈øorts of Ve≈ø≈øels a fourth is al≈øo added, which are the <hi>Nerves,</hi> with which they are well ≈øtored, having innumerable branches of them di≈øper≈øed through all their ≈øub≈øtance, accompanying the Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈ø≈øels and Pipes of the Wind-pipe; which Nerves do branch to them from the recurrent Nerves of the wandring pair.</p>
                        <p> Now the Lungs being thus interwoven with the≈øe four ≈øorts of Ve≈ø≈øels, are covered with a ≈øtrong <hi>skin,</hi> or indeed two skins, for it is no hard matter to ≈øeparate it into two.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe skins are furni≈øhed with very many pores or holes of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent largene≈øs, plain to be ≈øeen (≈øaith <hi>Bartholin</hi>) if you blow up the Lungs with a pair of Bellows or Pipe. Which he doth not onely affirm that him≈øelf hath ≈øeen, but al≈øo quotes <hi>Johannes Waloeus,</hi> who (≈øaith he) hath ob≈øerved them to be in Live-anatomies as large as to contain a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty big Pea≈øe. Such pores, perhaps, there may be di≈øcernible in Live-anatomies, though whether ≈øo large as to receive a Pea≈øe I ≈øomewhat
<pb facs="tcp:57416:73"/>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57416:73"/>que≈øtion. Indeed I had never my ≈øelf the opportunity of ob≈øerving the Lungs in Creatures yet alive, but as ≈øoon as they have been dead, though I have made never ≈øo great ha≈øte to take the Lungs out before they ≈øhould be any thing cold, yet I could never ≈øee any of them, although I have blown the wind through the Wind-pipe with ≈øuch violence, that I have broke ≈øome of the ≈ømall branches of it, and with the ≈øaid wind have rai≈øed little bladders in the outer skin of the Lungs; I ≈øay notwith≈øtanding, I could never ≈øee or di≈øcern any of the≈øe little pores, that did let any of the ≈øaid wind out, but the wind hath continued in tho≈øe little bladders ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days. Which experiment I alledge not with a de≈øign to di≈øprove tho≈øe worthy and learned Anatomi≈øts, that affirm to have ≈øeen them; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ≈øhew that if any ≈øuch there be, nothing pa≈ø≈øes through them out of the Lungs into the Che≈øt. But now on the other hand, that ≈øomething may be received by them out of the cavity of the Che≈øt into the Lungs, is not improbable; ≈øeeing one cannot imagine how corrupt purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter collected in the Che≈øt from an Impo≈øthume breaking in it, or the like, ≈øhould by any other way get into the Wind-pipe, ≈øo as to be cough'd up, which it often is as well in Hor≈øes as in Men. If the inve≈øting skins be removed in any part of the Lungs, and afterwards one blow into them through the Wind-pipe, then will the Air i≈ø≈øue pretty ≈øtrongly out at the Breach. The outer of the skins is ≈ømooth and thin, but the inner is pretty thick, and on its in≈øide rough, appearing like an Honey-comb, by rea≈øon of the extremities of the Ve≈ø≈øels, and of the bladders ending at it. Both growing clo≈øe together as they do, make a very ≈øtrong Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which is very nece≈ø≈øary; for otherwi≈øe in anhelation, or deep and violent in≈øpiration, it would have been in danger of breaking when the Lungs are ≈øo much di≈øtended, to the great inconvenience if not certain death of the Creature to which it ≈øhould ≈øo have happened.</p>
                        <p> Having fini≈øhed the de≈øcription of the ≈øeveral things of which the Lungs are compounded or framed, in the next place we proceed to ≈øpeak of their <hi>action</hi> and <hi>u≈øe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their fir≈øt <hi>u≈øe</hi> then is, (according to <hi>Galen</hi>) to ≈øerve as a ≈øoft Pillow or Bol≈øter for the Heart to re≈øt upon, that the hardne≈øs of the Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them ≈øhould not offend it in its pul≈øation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They are the in≈øtruments of re≈øpiration or breathing, which is their proper <hi>action.</hi> Now re≈øpiration is performed by two motions of the Lungs, <hi>viz.</hi> dilatation and contraction. When they are dilated, they receive in Air, and this is termed <hi>in≈øpiration;</hi> but when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, they expel or drive forth the Air, which is called <hi>expiration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>While the Air is drawn in in in≈øpiration, a double benefit accrews to the Bea≈øt: Fir≈øt his Heart and Bloud are thereby cooled; whence we ≈øee that the hotter he is, the more frequently he draws his breath, that the bloud may be the more fanned by the cool Air. Secondly, hereby the vital flame is continued; for as an ordinary Fire is extingui≈øhed by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the Air from it, ≈øo does the Animal die when it is denied Air to breathe in. To the≈øe benefits of in≈øpiration may be added, that when the Lungs are heaved up by the Air drawn in, their ≈øub≈øtance is rarefied, ≈øo that there is granted a freer circulation of the bloud through them.</p>
                        <p>The Air having performed the≈øe offices, by its ≈øtay in the Lungs it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hot, and ≈øo can be of no further u≈øe for cooling the Heart and Bloud; and its nitrous particles are con≈øumed by the vital flame that feeds upon them, and therefore it becomes nece≈ø≈øary to expel it, that there may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57416:74"/>be room for new and fre≈øh Air to be drawn in for the u≈øes afore≈øaid. So that this drawing in and expelling the Air ≈øucceed one another by turns, and an≈øwer to the <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> and <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> of the Heart; onely this motion of the Lungs is partly voluntary and partly natural, but that of the Heart wholly natural.</p>
                        <p>But neither is <hi>expiration</hi> or breathing forth without its particular u≈øes; for by it are vented or voided the ≈ømoaky or ≈øooty ≈øteams or excrements of the Heart and arterial Bloud, (which excrements are brought from the Heart through the pneumonick Artery with the bloud:) al≈øo the thin and thick excrements of the Lungs gathered in the branches of the Wind-pipe are by this motion of expiration, (heighten'd into a cough) brought into the one great trunk thereof, through which as through a Reed it is driven by the force of the Air up to the Mouth and No≈øe, to be by them voided.</p>
                        <p>Of what nature the motion of the Lungs is, and by what Mu≈øcles of the Brea≈øt it is a≈ø≈øi≈øted, the Reader may inform him≈øelf in the fourth Chapter of this Book that treats of the Midriff, who≈øe motion corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øponds to this of the Lungs.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Neck</hi> is called in Latin <hi>Collum, √† colle,</hi> from an hillock; for it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth out of the Body as an hill doth out of the re≈øt of the Earth.</p>
                        <p>It comprehends the di≈øtance between the Head and Brea≈øt, and its Parts are <hi>containing,</hi> or <hi>contained:</hi> as for the former, they are ≈øuch as are found in the other Parts of the Body; but</p>
                        <p>The Parts <hi>contained</hi> are peculiar to it ≈øelf, and are the≈øe: the Gullet, the Wind-pipe, the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or Joints of the Neck, and its Mu≈øcles. Of the≈øe two latter we ≈øhall di≈øcour≈øe in the Fourth and Fifth Books; and of the two former, we treated of one in the Fir≈øt Book, as belonging to the Stomach, and of the other in this as pertaining to the Lungs. But becau≈øe the uppermo≈øt parts of both the≈øe next to the Throat are di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh'd from the re≈øt by peculiar names and have particular u≈øes, we ≈øhall treat of them in this Chapter. Now the top of the Wind-pipe is called <hi>Larynx,</hi> and of the Gullet, <hi>Pharynx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Larynx</hi> or Throttle is ≈øituated, as hath been ≈øaid, at the upper part of the Neck, adjoining to the root of the Tongue. It is in Humane Bodies the in≈øtrument of the Voice, and in what≈øoever other Creatures, of that noi≈øe which they make, by what name ≈øoever it be di≈øtingui≈øhed, as particularly of the <hi>neighing</hi> of an Hor≈øe.</p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57416:75"/>
                        <p> Its <hi>figure</hi> is round and almo≈øt circular, onely bunching a little out on the fore≈øide, and depre≈ø≈øed as much on the back-part next to the Gullet, for the Gullets better and more ≈øecure pa≈ø≈øage, and that the meat in ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing might not be hindred from de≈øcending by it.</p>
                        <p> It is framed of five <hi>Cartilages</hi> or <hi>Gri≈øtles,</hi> the fir≈øt of which is called <hi>Scutiformis</hi> or Buckler-like, becau≈øe it re≈øembles a Shield or Buckler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hollow within and bunching without. In Humane Bodies (in Men more e≈øpecially, for Women have it not ≈øo far ≈øticking out as Men) this bunching out is by ≈øome Anatomi≈øts termed <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apple, from an old Tradition that a part of the fatal Apple abode ≈øticking in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Throat in that place.</p>
                        <p>The next or ≈øecond Gri≈øtle of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is called <hi>Annularis</hi> from the re≈øemblance it hath to a Turki≈øh Ring, wherewith they arm their Thumb when they ≈øhoot. This Gri≈øtle is round, and incompa≈ø≈øeth the whole <hi>Larynx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third and fourth, becau≈øe as they are joined together they re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the neck of an Ewer, are called <hi>Guttales.</hi> The≈øe two Gri≈øtles many times pa≈øs for one, becau≈øe they have but one skin proper to them both, and untill that skin be removed they are not to be parted. The≈øe two form the <hi>glottis</hi> or little tongue, being a chink of that ≈øhape.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is termed <hi>Epiglottis</hi> becau≈øe it is placed above the <hi>glottis</hi> or chink. The ≈øub≈øtance of this is ≈øoft, and its ≈øhape like an Ivy-leaf. Its u≈øe is to hinder the falling down of any thing that may be offen≈øive to the Wind-pipe, when the Creature doth ≈øwallow either his meat or drink.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Cartilages are moved by ≈øeveral pairs of <hi>Mu≈øcles,</hi> which ≈øhall be de≈øcribed in the Fourth Book.</p>

                        <p> The <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of the <hi>Larynx</hi> are of all ≈øorts. <hi>Veins</hi> are derived to it from the external Jugulars; <hi>Arteries</hi> from the large branch of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides;</hi> Its <hi>Nerves</hi> it hath from the recurrent Nerves of the (eighth, commonly reckoned for the) ≈øixth pair, which are called in tho≈øe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which have voices, <hi>vocales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> There are al≈øo <hi>two</hi> ≈øorts of <hi>Kernels</hi> belonging to it. One pair is called <hi>Ton≈øillae,</hi> which are placed at the ≈øides of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula,</hi> and at the upper part of the <hi>Larynx.</hi> The≈øe are tho≈øe which in Humane Bodies are called the <hi>Almonds of the Ears,</hi> and are of this u≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ≈øeparate that fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick humour from the bloud that makes the ≈ølaver; which humour ≈øerves to moi≈øten it, and al≈øo the Gullet, that by their glibne≈øs or ≈ølippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine≈øs they may the better ≈øerve for their re≈øpective u≈øes.</p>
                        <p>The other pair of Kernels are placed contrary to the former, namely at the lower end of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> in number two, one on each ≈øide of the Buckler-like Gri≈øtle. In Hor≈øes they are much larger than the former, and by them large branches of the external jugular Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do run. The≈øe are tho≈øe Kernels under the Throat or between the Jaws of an Hor≈øe that one may plainly feel at any time, but more e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when an Hor≈øe has the Glanders, for in ≈øuch they are much ≈øwelled.</p>

                        <p> The <hi>Pharynx</hi> (or top of the Gullet) is ≈øo called from a Greek word that ≈øignifies <hi>to carry,</hi> becau≈øe it conveys the meat and drink from the Mouth toward the Stomach.

                        <argument>
                           <p>The common containing Parts of the Head. The proper containing Parts. The Mu≈øcles. The Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium. The Perio≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Dura me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx. Its connexion The falx. Its Sinus's. Tenuis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx. Its Ve≈ø≈øels. The u≈øe of the Meninges.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING fini≈øhed the de≈øcription of the two Lower <hi>Venters,</hi> which are two of the principal Parts of the Body; I come now in the next place to betake my ≈øelf to the la≈øt principal Part which is the <hi>Head,</hi> being the ≈øeat of the Animal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as the two lower are of the Vital and Natural.</p>
                        <p>In di≈ø≈øecting of this Part I ≈øhall follow the ≈øame method as in the two former, examining its Parts in order, as they offer them≈øelves to our ≈øight in di≈ø≈øection, fir≈øt dividing it into parts to that intent.</p>
                        <p>But before we begin to divide it, I think it will not be ami≈øs to ≈øpeak ≈øomething of its ≈øupereminency over all the other Parts; for in re≈øpect that it is the ≈øeat of the Sen≈øes, it is lookt upon by Anatomi≈øts to be the chief Man≈øion-hou≈øe of the Animal Soul; and Sen≈øe is ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living Creature, that without it, it is not far from being without life. And as the Head in this regard is the mo≈øt principal Part, ≈øo is it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ≈øituated in the uppermo≈øt place, above all the other Parts of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57416:78"/>Body, for this rea≈øon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Animal ≈øpirits as from a fountain might ≈øpring from thence, and communicate ≈øen≈øe and motion down to all Parts of the Body: but for the Eyes ≈øake more e≈øpecially has it this high ≈øituation, for thereby two conveniencies accrue to the ≈øen≈øe of ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fir≈øt, the Eyes being placed as in a Watch-tower, can di≈øcover things at the greater di≈øtance, and thereby prevent many dangers which might otherwi≈øe come unawares: and in the next place by being placed ≈øo near the fountain of Animal ≈øpirits, the optick Nerves, which are of a ≈øoft ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, and could not therefore endure a long pa≈ø≈øage, are ≈øecured from breaking.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>figure</hi> or ≈øhape of the Head, I will omit ≈øpeaking of that, ≈øince it is ≈øo vi≈øible and ≈øo common to be ≈øeen. And though ≈øomething might be ≈øpoken as to the true and mo≈øt natural ≈øhape of an Hor≈øe's Head, yet that being already de≈øcribed by other Authours, and may by me (if God ≈øhall ≈øo long ≈øpare my life) be treated of more at large in another Book which I de≈øign to ≈øet forth of the ≈øeveral Cures performed by me, by ≈øuch means and methods as I have experimented ≈øince I came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand Anatomy; I ≈øhall wave it at this time, and ≈øpeak no more of the Head in general, but proceed to treat of its Parts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Parts</hi> of the Head, (as of the other two <hi>Venters</hi> before di≈øcour≈øed of) may be di≈øtingui≈øhed into Parts <hi>containing</hi> and <hi>contained.</hi> The <hi>contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are either <hi>common</hi> or <hi>proper;</hi> of which in order.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt then of its <hi>common containing</hi> Parts; the fir≈øt of which is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle with its hairs, of which we have ≈øufficiently treated in the fir≈øt Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book; the next is the <hi>cutis</hi> or True skin, al≈øo the Fat and fle≈øhy Pannicle, of all which we have treated at large in the five fir≈øt Chapters of the Fir≈øt Book, whither the Reader may plea≈øe to turn back for his better information.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>proper containing</hi> Parts of the Head are five, namely the Mu≈øcles, the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> the <hi>Perio≈øteum,</hi> the Skull, and the Membranes or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges</hi> contained within it.</p>
                        <p>To the <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> we will ≈øpeak in the next Book which is of the Mu≈øcles,as being the mo≈øt proper place.</p>
                        <p>The fle≈øhy Pannicle or <hi>membrana carno≈øa</hi> together with the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inve≈øting Parts above it being removed, the <hi>Pericranium</hi> next appears, which is a thin, white and very ≈øen≈øible Membrane ≈øpread over the whole Skull, adhering immediately to the <hi>Perio≈øteum</hi> every-where, ≈øaving where the temporal Mu≈øcles on each ≈øide come between them. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈ølender Fibres that pa≈øs from this Membrane through the ≈øutures or ≈øeams of the Skull, which are knit to the <hi>cra≈ø≈øa meninx</hi> or outer skin, which cloaths the Brain on the in≈øide of the Scull; whence ≈øome are of opinion that the <hi>Pericranium</hi> has its ri≈øe from it. Whether that be ≈øo or no, the≈øe Fibres however ≈øerve to ≈øtay the <hi>dura mater</hi> in its place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hinders the Brain which it inve≈øts from being cla≈øh'd again≈øt the ruggid Skull in violent concu≈ø≈øions of the Head.</p>
                        <p>The next inve≈øting Part is the <hi>Perio≈øteum,</hi> which is a Skin of much alike ≈øub≈øtance with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> onely thinner. It is of the ≈øame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that Membrane that inve≈øts all the Bones in the whole Body, excepting the Teeth which are bare. From this Membrane it is that the Skull as well as all other bones are ≈øen≈øible, for of them≈øelves they are ≈øen≈øle≈øs Parts. It ≈øticks very clo≈øe to the Skull, and it, as well as the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricranium,</hi> has <hi>Arteries</hi> from the external <hi>Carotides,</hi> and <hi>Veins</hi> from the external Jugulars.</p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57416:78"/>
                        <p>We ≈øhould in the next place ≈øpeak to the Bones of the Head, or the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bones of the Skull di≈øtingui≈øhed by ≈øeveral ≈øutures; but I omit them al≈øo here, and ≈øhall ≈øpeak to them in their proper place, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Fifth Book) and proceed to the Parts within the Skull, the fir≈øt of which is the <hi>dura meninx,</hi> that is, the hard Skin or Membrane, called likewi≈øe <hi>cra≈ø≈øa meninx,</hi> to di≈øtingui≈øh it from the <hi>thinner</hi> that lies next under it, and immediately cloaths the Brain.</p>
                        <p>This hard or thick Membrane is called by many Authours <hi>dura mater</hi> or the hard mother, becau≈øe they conceive that mo≈øt of the Skins of the whole Body do ≈øpring from it, and therefore it is e≈øteemed as their mother.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>amplitude</hi> an≈øwer to the Bones of the Skull, by rea≈øon it inve≈øteth all its cavities. It is knit, and that very ≈øtrongly, to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Skull, to its proce≈ø≈øes, and to the circles of its holes, from whence it cannot ea≈øily be removed. It is ≈øu≈øpended al≈øo by the Fibres above-≈øpoken of that come through the ≈øutures of the Skull from the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricranium,</hi> as likewi≈øe by the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels that penetrate the Skull and are in≈øerted into this Membrane. By which Ve≈ø≈øels it is in like manner fa≈øtened to the Skin under it called the <hi>pia mater,</hi> and in ≈øeveral places to the Brain it ≈øelf. It con≈øi≈øts of two Skins, as the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> of the Lowe≈øt <hi>Venter,</hi> and the <hi>Pleura</hi> of the middle do. In its upper part it is doubled, and its duplicature divides the Brain into two parts, the right and left. This duplicature being in the hinder part broad, and growing nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower ≈øtill as it inclines to the fore-part, I mean towards the No≈øe, is by Phy≈øicians called <hi>falx</hi> or the ≈øickle, becau≈øe in a Man's Head which is pretty round, it makes almo≈øt an half circle, as a ≈øickle does. We may retain the ≈øame name for it in an Hor≈øe, though le≈øs properly, as differing ≈øomewhat in ≈øhape.</p>
                        <p>In this reduplication there are ≈øeveral cavities or hollowne≈ø≈øes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by the Latin name <hi>≈øinus,</hi> which are accounted receptacles of abounding bloud and ≈øpirits; by <hi>Galen</hi> they are called the Ventricles of the <hi>dura mater,</hi> by others ci≈øterns of bloud. The highe≈øt of the≈øe, and al≈øo the longe≈øt, doth run all along the top or upper part of the <hi>falx</hi> from the No≈øe length-ways of the Head towards the Noll, where it is divided into ≈øeveral branches, two of which de≈øcend downwards to the bottom of the <hi>occiput,</hi> and a third runs to the <hi>glandula pinealis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Into the≈øe hollowne≈ø≈øes or <hi>≈øinus's</hi> the mouths of the Veins and Arteries are ≈øaid to open, the Arteries pouring bloud into them, and the Veins receiving it from them again, as hath been ob≈øerved in the di≈ø≈øecting the Heads of living Creatures, for in the long or uppermo≈øt <hi>≈øinus</hi> hath been ≈øeen a ≈øtrong beating or pul≈øe occa≈øioned by the bloud that is di≈øcharged into it by the Arteries.</p>
                        <p>The other Membrane or Skin which inve≈øts the Brain is called <hi>tenuis meninx</hi> from its thinne≈øs, and <hi>pia mater</hi> or tender mother from its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate covering or clo≈øe ≈øticking to the Brain, imbracing it as a Mother does her Infant. It is ≈øpread over all the cortical or outer part of the Brain, in≈øinuating it ≈øelf into all its windings, as al≈øo into tho≈øe of the <hi>cerebellum</hi> and <hi>medulla oblongata,</hi> and ties all their proce≈ø≈øes and parts to one another, that they cannot be di≈øplaced or bear hard upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whereever it goes, the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels run along it, and are di≈øper≈øed out of it into the Parts that it cloaths.</p>
                        <p>This Skin is very thin, and of a mo≈øt exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe, yea this and the <hi>dura mater</hi> ≈øeem to be the in≈øtruments of all ≈øen≈øation. For as ≈øen≈øe is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57416:79"/>communicated to every part immediately by the Nerves, ≈øo the nervous Fibres are more probably propagated from the≈øe Membranes that cloath the Nerves, than from the medullar Part it ≈øelf of the Nerve which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>medulla oblongata</hi> and ≈øpinal marrow, which of them≈øelves have little or no ≈øen≈øe, but onely by virtue of the≈øe Membranes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt them.</p>
                        <p>It is furni≈øhed with very many Arteries and Veins, mo≈øt of which are exceeding ≈ømall, but in number infinite, interwoven one with another in the manner of a Net. The Arteries do ≈øpring from the <hi>Carotides</hi> and Cervical Arteries, and the Veins from the jugular Veins.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the≈øe two Membranes that inve≈øt the Brain is to ≈øu≈øtain the Ve≈ø≈øels that enter into it, to cloath and defend it from the hardne≈øs of the Parts that environ it, to keep it in its due form and ≈øituation (for of it ≈øelf it would run all about, it is of ≈øo ≈øoft a con≈øi≈øtency) and la≈øtly to afford a coat to all the Nerves, not onely to tho≈øe that ≈øpring within the Skull, but to all tho≈øe al≈øo that ari≈øe out of the Back-bone, for the≈øe two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are propagated all along it, inve≈øting its pith, (called the ≈øpinal marrow) out of which tho≈øe Nerves ≈øpring.</p>

                           <p>The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Brain. That an Hor≈øe hath a Brain.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BEING come to treat of the <hi>Brain,</hi> it ≈øhall not be ami≈øs, if before I ≈øpeak of its ≈øeveral Parts, I ≈øay ≈øomething as to its excellency, and the eminent offices it performs for the benefit of the Animal. All Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours agree that it is one of the mo≈øt noble Parts of the whole Body, ranked for its dignity even with the Heart it ≈øelf. And indeed, as I have intimated in the foregoing Chapter, its ≈øituation ≈øheweth plainly as much, it being placed in the highe≈øt part of all the Body, and there fenced about as it were with ≈øtrong walls on every ≈øide, to ≈øecure it from outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. In it are contained the Animal Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe of Sen≈øe and Motion. The former of the≈øe two Faculties ≈øits in it as in a Throne of Maje≈øty, beholding the forms of all things under her feet, having all the Organs and In≈øtruments of the Sen≈øes attending Her, at her command. For fir≈øt the Eyes are placed near her, that as Spies or Centinels watching day and night they may di≈øcover the Enemy. The Ears al≈øo are ≈øeated near her, at her command to be turned this way or that way, to li≈øten to any dangers that are approaching, that ≈øo they may be avoided. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the In≈øtruments of Smelling and Ta≈øting are near her, that at her command tho≈øe Foods that are profitable and nece≈ø≈øary may be received, and that unplea≈øant or hurtfull Food may be rejected. And as the Faculty of Sen≈øation hath the forementioned Mini≈øters or In≈øtruments placed near her for the execution of her offices; ≈øo hath the motive Faculty a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion extended to the furthe≈øt limits of the Body, of which every Limb and Member is perfectly at her beck, to move this way or that way as ≈øhe directs. I ≈øay, both the≈øe noble Faculties have their ≈øeat in the Brain;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57416:79"/>for it is not a private or particular Organ of Sen≈øe, but an univer≈øal one; nor doth the motive Faculty exert it ≈øelf in the Brain it ≈øelf, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of <hi>voluntary</hi> motion; but that motion which it has, is <hi>natural,</hi> and that not owing to it ≈øelf, but to the Arteries that are di≈øper≈øed in it, for the beating of the≈øe makes it ≈øeem to widen, and contract it ≈øelf, as hath been ob≈øerved in Wounds of the Heads of both Men and Bea≈øts. This motion, I ≈øay, is communicated to it from the Arteries, and in its dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it receives arterial bloud by the Carotid Arteries, and in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction it forces that Bloud into the Veins, and the Animal Spirits into the Nerves, by which they are carried into all Parts of the Body, and with them the moving power is imparted; for without ≈øuch influence from the brain an Animal would be like a Log, it would be able neither to move nor feel, or rather it would cea≈øe to be an Animal, and become a dead Carca≈øe.</p>
                        <p>How ab≈øurd and ridiculous a thing is it then for any Man that hath any Brain him≈øelf, to imagine a Hor≈øe to have none? yet ≈øuch Men I have my ≈øelf met withall, yea I know ≈øeveral which to this day will not be convinced of that erroneous opinion by any arguments whatever. Neither will they take the pains to in≈øpect the Parts, to ≈øatisfy them≈øelves of the contrary, but will ≈øtill continue in their fal≈øe received opinion, merely taken from a ≈øilly ob≈øervation they have made when they have ≈øeen Hor≈øes and Oxen knocked on the Head, where they ≈øee the Skull broken and nothing under it, but a few hard and dry Bones, without any marrowy ≈øub≈øtance: I ≈øay from this ob≈øervation they draw their conclu≈øion, that a Hor≈øe hath no Brain. I much wonder how any ≈øuch Dolt can have the confidence to take upon him the name of a Farrier, and pretend to cure he knows not what. Such Per≈øons I would de≈øire onely when they ≈øee another Hor≈øe knockt on the Head, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them that doe it, (or otherwi≈øe when any Hor≈øe is dead) to ≈øtrike him a blow or two with the ≈øame force above the u≈øual place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ears or a very little lower, and they ≈øhall then be ≈øoon convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he hath a Brain, (though not ≈øo <hi>large</hi> by much as a Man hath, con≈øidering the different bulk of their Bodies.) And when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of that, I hope they will take pains to be ≈øatisfied in the other Parts of the Body by ≈øearching into them, as by the≈øe my Labours they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; ≈øo ≈øhall they improve them≈øelves in their profe≈ø≈øions, and I have the wi≈øhed end of my pains, which I have taken to advance them.</p>

                        <p>IF we take the <hi>Brain</hi> in a large ≈øignification, it comprehends all that marrowy ≈øub≈øtance that is found in the cavity of the Skull: yet for di≈øtinction's ≈øake it is by all Authours divided into three parts; fir≈øt, the fore-part, being the large≈øt, is called <hi>the Brain;</hi> ≈øecondly, the middle part is called <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the Brainlet or After-brain; and la≈øtly, the hindmo≈øt and lowermo≈øt is termed <hi>Medulla oblongata,</hi> being that part of the Spinal Marrow which is within the Skull.</p>
                        <p>Now to find out the≈øe ≈øeveral Parts we mu≈øt divide the Skull with a Saw for that purpo≈øe, beginning almo≈øt as far back as the Noll-bone, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed quite as far, dividing the hole of the Noll-bone in the middle, and ≈øo go with your Saw fir≈øt along one ≈øide of the Head a little above the auditory pa≈ø≈øage till you come to the Fore-head a little below the Eyes (or ju≈øt even with them;) where being come, and having ≈øawed onely ju≈øt through the Skull, (for you mu≈øt have a care that your Saw do not pierce the Brain, for that will hinder your ≈øeeing the Parts of it) then cro≈øs the Fore-head with your Saw and pa≈øs along the other ≈øide till you come to the hole of the Noll-bone again: by doing which you will loo≈øen the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Skull, which with care you mu≈øt take off, that you break not the <hi>dura mater</hi> or Skin next under it, for that Skin is fa≈øtened to it in ≈øeveral places.

                        <p> Of the≈øe ≈øeveral Parts of the Brain we ≈øhall ≈øpeak in their order, and fir≈øt of that which is ≈øtrictly ≈øo called. It is of a marrowy ≈øub≈øtance, but not equally ≈øo, for the upper part of it u≈øes to be called its <hi>cortex</hi> or bark, being of a more dusky colour; whereas the inner or lower part is more white, and is particularly called the marrow or pith of the Brain. It is divided into two parts, a right and a left, by a Membrane that runs length-ways of the Head, from the Fore-head to the Noll; but this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion de≈øcends no deeper into the Brain than the A≈øh-coloured part of it reaches. The Skin which divides it, is called <hi>falx</hi> or the ≈øickle, of which I have already ≈øpoken in the fir≈øt Chapter.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>action</hi> of the Brain is to elaborate the Animal Spirits, which from it are tran≈ømitted to the <hi>Medulla oblongata,</hi> and from thence into the Nerves, for the ≈øen≈øation and motion of the whole Body, as has been more fully ≈øhewn in the two foregoing Chapters.</p>
                        <p> The ≈øecond part of the Brain, called the <hi>After-brain,</hi> is ≈øituated in the back-part of the Skull next the Noll-bone, onely parted from the Brain on its upper part by the <hi>pia mater</hi> or undermo≈øt Skin.</p>
                        <p>This differeth not much from the Brain either in colour or ≈øub≈øtance, but onely in its convolutions or foldings: for the Brain ob≈øerveth no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in its winding, but the Brainlet doth, for all its folds are circular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extended one over another like plates, and each is kept apart from other by the <hi>pia mater</hi> that inve≈øts each of them ≈øeverally.</p>
                        <p> It is framed of four Parts, whereof two are lateral, (or on each ≈øide) the right and the left; and the≈øe are ≈øpherical, or round like a Globe: The other two are in the middle betwixt the≈øe, ≈øtanding before and behind; and the≈øe are made up of ≈øeveral orbicular Portions in ≈øimilitude like the Worms which are found in rotten Timber, and are from thence called Worm-like Proce≈ø≈øes.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Brainlet or After-brain is the ≈øame as of the Brain.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Spinal Marrow contained within and without the Skull.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Spinal Marrow. Its ≈øub≈øtance. Its ri≈øe. Its figure. Its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes. Its u≈øe. The number of Nerves ≈øpringing from it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT part of the Spinal Marrow that is within the Brain, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med particularly <hi>medulla oblongata,</hi> and is the third part of the Brain, being of an uniform, white and compact ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øomething harder than either the Brain or After-brain.</p>
                        <p>It <hi>ari≈øes</hi> out of the Brain and Brainlet, and that from ≈øix roots; two of which ≈øpring at the upper and fore-part of the Brain, and are called <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora ≈øtriata,</hi> the ≈øtreaked or chamfered Bodies, being onely the ends of its two Thighs; the other four ari≈øe lower and more backward, by which it adheres to the Brainlet, and are tho≈øe protuberances or jettings out that are called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Te≈øtes,</hi> its Buttocks and Te≈øticles.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>figure</hi> (after its ri≈øe) is long and round, being thicker near its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning than afterwards. Its length within the Skull is about two inches, beginning towards the fore-part of the Head, and reaching to the Noll, whence it is lengthned and continued down the Chine as far as the Dock. That part of it which is contained in the Chine, we commonly call in Hor≈øes the pith of the Back.</p>
                        <p>Within the Skull it is clad onely with two <hi>Membranes;</hi> but without, it is covered with three. The fir≈øt of which it hath from the inner Skin of the Brain or <hi>pia mater;</hi> this immediately covers it. The ≈øecond it hath from the upper Skin of the Brain or <hi>dura mater;</hi> this is next to and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the former. And the third is ≈øaid to ≈øpring from a ≈øtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which binds together the fore-part of the Rack-bones, covering both the former, and is very ≈øtrong.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Spinal Marrow is to be the original of all the Nerves, which from it (as from a Fountain) like ≈ømall Rivulets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to all Parts of the Body the Animal Spirits. For although the Brain in common ≈øpeech be accounted the original of the Nerves; that is to be under≈øtood in a large ≈øen≈øe, when all the three Parts of the Brain are included in that one general appellation: But when the Brain comes to be divided into Parts, which are di≈øtingui≈øh'd by particular names, then are both the Brain and Brainlet thrown out of the office of being the original of the Nerves. For ocular In≈øpection doth te≈øtify, that it is from that part of the Spinal Marrow contained within the Skull, from which all the Nerves of the Brain do ≈øpring; as likewi≈øe from that part of the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, called the Pith or Marrow of the Back, that all the other Nerves of the whole Body do ari≈øe. Which large and far di≈øtant origination of the Nerves is very nece≈ø≈øary; for it would not have been ≈øafe (in con≈øideration of the length of the way) that all the Nerves ≈øhould be carried from the Brain to the inferior or lower Parts; and therefore it is wi≈øely provided by Nature, that from the Marrow or Pith of the back tho≈øe Nerves ≈øhould ≈øpring which furni≈øh the Parts ≈øo remote from the Brain.</p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57416:82"/>
                        <p>As for the <hi>number</hi> of Nerves which ≈øpring from the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, they are in a Hor≈øe thirty ≈øeven pair, according to the number of Joints or <hi>vertebrae</hi> from the Noll-bone or the going out of the Marrow from the head, to the ≈øetting on of the tail; for out of the holes or perforations in every Bone do pa≈øs a pair of Nerves. Therefore there being ≈øo many Bones, there are ≈øo many pair of Nerves that ≈øpring from the Spinal Marrow. And from the <hi>medulla oblongata</hi> or that part of the Spinal Marrow that is within the Skull, there ≈øpring nine pair, as ≈øhall be further ≈øhewed hereafter.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING given a ≈øhort de≈øcription of the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> (or Brain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ≈øo called) the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and Spinal Marrow; we now return to the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> to take a more exact view of its ≈øeveral Parts; and we ≈øhall begin with the <hi>Rete mirabile</hi> or wonderfull Net.</p>
                        <p>This Net is framed of innumerable twigs of Arteries which ≈øpring from the large≈øt branches of the Carotid and Cervical Arteries, which pa≈øs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Skull by proper holes in the Bones of the Temples. This Net is far more di≈øcernable in Oxen and Hor≈øes than in other le≈ø≈øer Animals.</p>
                        <p>It is called <hi>the wonderfull Net</hi> by rea≈øon of its ≈øtructure, the Arteries of which it is compo≈øed cro≈ø≈øing one another like the threds of a Net, or rather as if ≈øeveral Nets were ≈øpread one over another. It is di≈øper≈øed all over the bottom of the Brain both without and within the <hi>dura mater,</hi> ≈øome of the ≈ømalle≈øt ≈øhoots of it branching into the pituitary Glandule.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Net is ≈øaid to be for the preparing of the Bloud and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits to make Animal Spirits of. For which purpo≈øe in the twinings and windings of the≈øe ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels they are a long time detained, for the better elaboration and preparation of them, and le≈øt they might ru≈øh into the Brain in too full a ≈øtream, and thereby over≈ølow and di≈øturb the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faculty.</p>
                        <p>To ≈øee this wonderfull Net, as al≈øo the other Parts of the bottom or under-≈øide of the Brain, you mu≈øt (after having ≈øawn the Skull a≈øunder, as is ≈øhewed in the foregoing Chapter) with a pair of ≈øharp Pincers pinch off by little and little the ≈øides of the remaining part of the Skull, all round, untill you come as near the bottom as you can; and you mu≈øt then with as much care as po≈ø≈øible lift up the Brain, beginning at the fore-part of it, where the Bone of the Fore-head a little ≈øeparates it. After you have lifted it a little way up, there will come in ≈øight the mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Proce≈ø≈øes together with their nervous Filaments or Threds that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57416:83"/>pa≈øs through the Sieve-like Bone, hanging at them; which being loo≈øened and the Brain farther pulled up, the next thing that appeareth are the branches of the Carotid Arteries, which having penetrated the Skull are carried to the Brain; which being cut off and the Brain yet a little farther turned up, the unition or coming together, and the going out of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves are to be ≈øeen; the Trunks of which if you likewi≈øe cut off, there are other Arteries (al≈øo branches of the <hi>Carotides</hi>) to be ≈øeen, coming in through the Bones of the Temples: which Arteries (as I have already ≈øhewed) are (with ≈øome ≈ømall Veins joined with them) tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which make up the <hi>Rete mirabile</hi> or wonderfull Net, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed of at the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>After you have cut in ≈øunder the≈øe Arteries al≈øo, then you may by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Brain ≈øtill a little higher, perceive the moving Nerves of the Eyes (for <hi>they</hi> come next to view) and after them the other pairs of Nerves follow in order, in ≈øuch ≈øort, that one pair of them being cut off and the Brain with its Appendices or Proce≈ø≈øes more lifted up, the next is ≈øtill more plainly di≈øcerned by the carefull Anatomi≈øt. In which method and order all the Nerves, to which I ≈øhall particularly ≈øpeak in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, (I mean the Nerves ari≈øing within the Skull) and al≈øo the Arteries, as well the Carotid as Vertebral, being at length cut off, the whole frame of the Brain may be taken out of the Skull.</p>

This will be more plainly ≈øeen if you take the Brain out and leave the <hi>dura mater</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; for then you ≈øee it in its natural po≈øition, as the letter B in Fig. 2. of the foregoing Table ≈øhews it: but if you take the <hi>dura mater</hi> out, this comes out with it. This Kernel is called <hi>Glandula pituitaria,</hi> the ≈ønotty or flegmey Kernel, from its office, which is to receive the ≈ønotty Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Brain from the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> or Funnel, and afterward to tran≈ømit or convey them away, as ≈øome Authors ≈øay, into the Palate, from thence to be avoided by the Mouth or No≈øe. But others will have it, that it is ≈øent into the Jugular Veins by two ≈ømall ducts or pa≈ø≈øages, one on each ≈øide, being branches of one Trunk that begins at the bottom of the ≈øaid Gland, and is divided into two, after it has penetrated the wedge-like Bone. Which pa≈ø≈øages they have found out by injecting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of ≈øeveral colours with a ≈øyringe into them, for they have ob≈øerved the ≈øaid Liquors to pa≈øs into the Veins, but none to come to either the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or No≈øe. By which Experiment they conclude, that whatever <hi>≈øerum</hi> or wheyi≈øh or flegmatick Humour i≈ø≈øues out of the Ventricles of the Brain through the Funnel, di≈øtils not upon the Palate, but is poured again into the Bloud and mixed with it. Whence we may gather that the Rheum or Snot which i≈ø≈øueth ≈øo plentifully out of the No≈øes of Hor≈øes that have great Colds, and al≈øo of glander'd Hor≈øes, falls not (as I have my ≈øelf ≈øometimes thought) from the Brain, but is ≈øeparated out of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the Bloud by the Glands or Kernels of the upper part and in≈øide of the No≈øe. Which we may the rather believe, when we ob≈øerve that other Glands are ≈øwell'd with Rheum at the ≈øame time, as particularly the Kernels under the Hor≈øe's Jaws; which is one of the certaine≈øt ≈øigns we have of a Hor≈øe's inclining to the Glanders. And this may ≈øerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of errour all our ancient Authors who did hold, (and our Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who at this day do hold) that the Glanders proceed from a defect and wa≈øting in the Brain; and that all that ≈ønotty matter comes from thence which i≈ø≈øues out of the No≈øe. Which were it ≈øo, all the Brain in the Hor≈øe's Head would not be ≈øufficient to ≈øupply it with matter for three daies, according to the quantity that I have ≈øeen come from one in that time. It is therefore a very fal≈øe opinion, taken up merely upon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57416:85"/>gue≈øs, without in≈øpecting into the Parts, that our Practitioners do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly entertain concerning this Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                        <p> Neither is there ≈øuch a Di≈øea≈øe as the mourning of the Chine,as they do to this day hold; for it is impo≈ø≈øible any Creature ≈øhould continue ≈øo long alive as till all his Brain be ≈øo far wa≈øted by this Di≈øea≈øe, that it comes to reach the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, which is that I ≈øuppo≈øe they call the Chine.</p>
                        <p>But this Di≈øea≈øe, by them called the mourning of the Chine, is di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed into a different Di≈øea≈øe from the former from the Matter's altering its colour; for it is generally ob≈øerved that after the Hor≈øe hath had this Di≈øea≈øe running on him for ≈øome time, the corrupt Matter or Snot chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by degrees from an indifferent white to a more dull colour, inclining at fir≈øt to a little reddi≈øh, but after a longer time, e≈øpecially when the Hor≈øe begins to grow towards his end, it will be very black and very nau≈øeous both to ≈øee and ≈ømell.</p>
                        <p>From this alteration of the colour, as I have ≈øaid, I do believe they give the Di≈øea≈øe this proper and di≈øtingui≈øhing name of mourning of the Chine; whereas it is onely a greater degree of one and the ≈øame Di≈øea≈øe, in which the Chine is not at all affected, at lea≈øt no more than any other Part of the Body, all of which langui≈øhes away by this inveterate Di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. By what ≈øteps it proceeds, and how the Matter comes to alter its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, I will give you my opinion.</p>
                        <p>The ma≈øs of Bloud being depraved either by unwhol≈øome Food, or by great Colds, or la≈øtly by infection from the Air and from other Hor≈øes (for this Di≈øtemper is catching) this flegmatick Matter collected in it is ≈øpued out of the ends of the Arteries in the upper part of the No≈øtrils, about the ≈øpongie Bones chiefly; for in an Hor≈øe there is little of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes out of the Mouth, but it ≈øtill de≈øcends by the No≈øtrils. This Humour, I ≈øay, di≈øtilling out of the Arteries by the ≈øpongie Bones conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, doth in proce≈øs of time ≈øo fill the ≈øaid Bones with filthy Matter, that like a Sink or Chanel being choaked up with filth, there is not ≈øo free a pa≈ø≈øage for the Humour, as when the Di≈øea≈øe fir≈øt began; ≈øo that the Matter by that means is there ≈øtayed, and by its continuance there it acquires ≈øo bad a quality that it corrodes and cankers tho≈øe Bones, and indeed ulcerates and gangrenes all the pa≈ø≈øages of the No≈øtrils, till it have mortified and con≈øum'd them (as happens ≈øometimes to Venereal Per≈øons) and at length de≈øtroy'd the Bea≈øt: for indeed it is ≈øeldom or never cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when it is once come truly to be a Canker.</p>
                        <p>Now by the foulne≈øs of the≈øe Bones (as I have ≈øaid) that Matter or Snot which doth de≈øcend by the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, (which indeed doth at length drivel down in a greater quantity than before, by rea≈øon of the pa≈ø≈øages being widened from the Parts being gnawn a≈øunder by the cankered Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; I ≈øay that Matter or Snot which doth de≈øcend after this) is of a contrary colour to what it u≈øed to be, for it is become more black and wateri≈øh, mixed with a little Red, and hath a very ill ≈ømell: but this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens not from the Matter's flowing from a new Part, but is cau≈øed by rea≈øon of the foulne≈øs of the Parts through which it pa≈ø≈øeth, for from thence it hath its dye in a great degree.</p>
                        <p>Not but that there is yet another cau≈øe of it, which is the greater foulne≈øs of the Bloud: for as the beginning of the Di≈øtemper did proceed from the corruption or depravation of the Bloud, which was become as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from its ≈øpirituous, bal≈øamick and volatili≈øed condition, into a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57416:85"/>flat and vappid ≈øtate, like to dead Wine; ≈øo in proce≈øs of time for want of the Spirits to quicken it, and cau≈øe the fermentations nece≈ø≈øary in the proper places of the Body, where the excrementitious parts of the bloud ≈øhould be thrown off, (there being ≈øeveral Bowels of the Body appointed to ≈øeparate, and ≈øome that have Receptacles to receive the ≈øame) I ≈øay, for want of the≈øe Spirits to cau≈øe a fermentation whereby the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious parts of the Bloud ≈øhould be thrown off, ≈øuch Excrements are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected every day in greater quantity, and acquire a greater degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, being hardly any part of them di≈øcharged any other way but this, which is preternatural, and mo≈øt times becomes de≈øtructive to the Bea≈øt, after the Di≈øea≈øe hath arrived to this height.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I given you my opinion concerning this Di≈øtemper, which though it be new, will I hope to the intelligent Reader appear to be truer than that of our Ancient or Modern Practitioners, few of whom (I may affirm without boa≈øting) have made ≈øo diligent an inquiry into this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtemper as I with great pains and charge have done; for if they had, they would with great ea≈øe ≈øee them≈øelves in an error, and no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is or can be ≈øuch a Di≈øea≈øe as the mourning of the Chine. But enough of this, (though I hope it will not be deemed to be from the purpo≈øe:) I ≈øhall therefore return from whence I have digre≈ø≈øed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe the remaining Parts of the Brain.</p>
                        <p>Having examined ≈øufficiently the <hi>Rete mirabile</hi> or wonderfull Net, as al≈øo the Pituitary Gland, if you then remove the <hi>dura mater</hi> quite from the Brain at the ba≈øis or bottom of it, there will appear the head of the Spinal Marrow, ≈øo much as is contained within the Skull, of which we have treated in a foregoing Chapter. There may be al≈øo plainly ≈øeen the ri≈øe of the ≈øeveral conjugations or pairs of Nerves, of which we will treat at large in a convenient place; al≈øo the bottom of the Cerebel or After-brain, as the next Table doth demon≈øtrate to you.</p>
                        <p> After the≈øe you may take a plain view of the end of the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> or Funnel, (a cavity ≈øo called) which end reaches (before di≈ø≈øection) to the Pituitary Gland, upon which it pours the flegmatick Excrements of the Brain, as hath been already ≈øhewed.</p>
                        <p>This Funnel is ≈øo called from its ≈øhape; for above, the head thereof is large; but the lower part, is a long and ≈øtrait Pipe. By ≈øome Authors it is called <hi>Pelvis</hi> the Ba≈øin. Its beginning is ≈øaid to be on the fore-part of the <hi>third</hi> Ventricle, by ≈øome ≈øo called, but I could never in a Hor≈øe ≈øee more than two that I could properly call Ventricles, between which two this Funnel is ≈øeated, and into which they do empty them≈øelves, di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their ≈øerous or wateri≈øh moi≈øture into it. This Funnel I have often found near filled with a thicki≈øh Flegm; and Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> ≈øays that in an Hor≈øe's Brain he has ob≈øerved it wider than a Goo≈øe-quill, and full of a clear Water.</p>
                        <p> Next come we to ≈øpeak to tho≈øe Parts of the Brain that lie hid, and cannot well be ≈øeen without di≈ø≈øecting of it; and fir≈øt of the <hi>Buttocks</hi> and <hi>Stones.</hi> The≈øe are four orbicular Prominences or round Bodies jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the <hi>medulla oblongata</hi> (or head of the Spinal Marrow) of which the two fir≈øt, namely the Buttocks, are large≈øt, and the latter (<hi>viz.</hi> the Stones) ≈øeem to be onely accre≈øcences to them. The Buttocks ≈øtand lowermo≈øt, and adhere to the Brainlet; (as do al≈øo the Stones.) They are larger than in a Man, and look of a fle≈øhy colour while they are cloathed with the <hi>pia mater;</hi> but that being removed, they appear
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57416:86"/>yellowi≈øh, and of a different colour from the re≈øt of the Marrow. But of the≈øe we di≈øcour≈øed before at the beginning of the fourth Chapter; as al≈øo of the <hi>corpora ≈øtriata</hi> or utmo≈øt ends of the <hi>medulla oblongata,</hi> that adhere to the Brain properly ≈øo called.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe four Prominences are by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> compared to Mole-hills, and are therefore by him ≈øo called. They may be plainly ≈øeen if you but lift up the hinder part of the Brain after you have ≈øeparated it from the After-brain, turning it as far back as you can without breaking it.</p>
                        <p> Between the≈øe four Prominences, or rather between the two lower of them, to wit the Buttocks, there is placed a certain Glandule or Kernel, which goes by the name of <hi>glandula pinealis,</hi> or Pine-kernel Glandule, from the re≈øemblance it is ≈øaid to have with the Kernel of a Pine-apple. It is al≈øo called the Yard or Prick of the Brain, from its being placed ≈øo near the Buttocks and Stones, as al≈øo becau≈øe it re≈øembleth a Man's Yard. This Gland as al≈øo the Buttocks and Te≈øticles before-≈øpoken of are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented in the next Table.</p>
                        <p> Concerning the <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Glandule there are great di≈øputes among the Learned; but I ≈øub≈øcribe to <hi>Bartholin</hi>'s opinion, who believeth its u≈øe to be the ≈øame with that of other Kernels, which is to ≈øeparate the <hi>Lympha</hi> from the Arterial Bloud.</p>
                        <p>There is as it were a chink between the Buttocks near this Glandule, which I think fit to mention, becau≈øe mo≈øt Authours ≈øpeak of it. Some give it the name of <hi>Anus</hi> or Ar≈øe, others call it <hi>Vulva;</hi> but why they have impo≈øed ≈øuch names as the≈øe upon the≈øe Parts, I cannot judge, nor is it worth the while to inquire, ≈øeeing they have no other foundation but fancy: however, ≈øince they are known by the≈øe names, I did think it fit not to pa≈øs them by, finding them as plainly to be ≈øeen and as ea≈øie to be found in Hor≈øes as Anatomi≈øts find them in Humane Brains.</p>
                        <p> I come in the next place to ≈øpeak to the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain, which are by ≈øome accounted four, by others three; but if di≈ø≈øection be made by beginning from beneath, there will appear onely two: and indeed I could never find more; for that which is called the third, I cannot think to be one, but rather a portion of the other two joined together. Nay, ≈øome Authours will have it that there is but one, being onely divided at the beginning, but at the end they unite into and become one common Cavity, as any one that will diligently trace them may ob≈øerve.</p>
                        <p> To ≈øee the≈øe Ventricles you mu≈øt cut the whole ≈øub≈øtance of the Brain in≈øunder in or as near the middle as you can gue≈øs, dividing the upper from the lower ≈øide, whereby you will di≈øcover them in the middle of the Brain of that ≈øhape as the fir≈øt Figure of the following Table repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents them in: for there they are repre≈øented to the life, as much of them I mean, as can be ≈øeen without farther di≈ø≈øection; and appear to be of a ≈øemicircular or Half-moon ≈øhape. But if you cut the Brain further, and ≈øo follow their Cavities lightly with a Probe <hi>forwards</hi> down towards the No≈øe (for there they ≈øink deep into the callous body, or white inner part of the Brain) you will trace them as far as the mammillary Proce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; and if <hi>backwards,</hi> you will find them to de≈øcend as far as the ba≈øis or bottom of the Brain; and then if you will take a view of them when you have laid them ≈øo far bare both ways, you will find them to re≈øemble in ≈øhape in Hor≈øe-≈øhoe.</p>
                        <p> Now the <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the≈øe Ventricles according to the divers opinions of Authours are many, but I will follow the mo≈øt Modern in this point.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57416:87"/>Fir≈øt then they are framed for the more ea≈øie pa≈ø≈øage of the Bloud; for along their ≈øides do pa≈øs many branches of the Bloud-carrying Ve≈ø≈øels, which could not ≈øo conveniently be conveyed through the ≈øub≈øtance of the Brain, le≈øt being compre≈ø≈øed by the great weight of it, the pa≈ø≈øage of the Bloud ≈øhould have been ob≈øtructed, whereas now it hath a free pa≈ø≈øage.</p>
                        <p>Another u≈øe of them is, to ≈øerve for the reception of the ≈øerous or wheyie excrement of the Bloud that is ≈øeparated from it by the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Skin that inve≈øts them, and by the <hi>glandula pituitaria;</hi> which ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humour i≈ø≈øuing out of the Arteries, is ≈øuckt up again by branches of the Jugular Veins, and is by them returned with the Bloud to the Heart.</p>
                        <p>In the Membrane that cloaths the≈øe Ventricles there is a contexture of ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels of both Veins and Arteries, which is called <hi>plexus Choroides.</hi> The Ve≈ø≈øels that make up this <hi>plexus,</hi> are little branches of the Carotid Arteries, and ≈øome of the internal Jugular Veins interwoven with them. The Skin wherein the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels are ≈øo interwoven has a great many ≈ømall Kernels ≈øticking in it, which as I have already ≈øaid, ≈øeparate the ≈øerous Matter from the Bloud.</p>
                        <p>In the Anatomical Di≈øcour≈øes of Humane Brains there are ≈øeveral other Parts of the Brain con≈øidered, as the <hi>fornix,</hi> the <hi>corpus callo≈øum,</hi> the <hi>≈øep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum lucidum</hi> and the like, all which are as di≈øcernible in the Brains of Hor≈øes as in Men, and might therefore as largely be di≈øcour≈øed of: but it being not very material to treat of them, I will for brevity ≈øake but in a manner name them.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt then, that which is called the <hi>corpus callo≈øum,</hi> is the white ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the Brain, plainly ≈øeen when you cut the Brain a≈øunder in the middle to ≈øee its Ventricles; for then you may view its white ≈øub≈øtance which makes the middle part of the Brain; the out≈øide of it being of an A≈øh-colour, and going by the name of <hi>cortex,</hi> or <hi>the bark.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øeptum lucidum</hi> is onely the Partition that divides the two Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles above-de≈øcribed, ≈øome taking it to be a reduplication of the <hi>pia mater,</hi> and others a portion of the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fornix</hi> or Vault is a kind of an Arch that ≈øtands between the Brain and the <hi>medulla oblongata.</hi> It is of a ≈øub≈øtance like the <hi>corpus callo≈øum,</hi> and is of a triangular figure. Its u≈øe is to bear up the upper part of the Brain, that its weight may not pre≈øs upon the ≈øubjacent Parts.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Action of the Brain, and the exerci≈øes of the Animal Faculty by the Nerves and Fibres.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The action of the Brain. What the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits are made of. How the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits enter into the Nerves; And how into the Fibres. Whence the Fibres ari≈øe. They can move by the Spirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING hitherto ≈øpoken of the ≈øtructure of the Brain, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed of all its Parts; I come in the next place to ≈øpeak of its <hi>Action,</hi> in general, and to ≈øhew, according to the opinion of our mo≈øt Learned and Modern Authours, how the Animal Faculty exerts it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>It is generally agreed that the proper <hi>action</hi> of the Brain (taken in a large ≈øen≈øe) is the elaborating of Animal Spirits; which Spirits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from it by the Nerves into the ≈øeveral Parts of the Body for the performing of the Animal actions or motions; for all voluntary motions are performed by the help of the≈øe Spirits.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Spirits are made out of the Vital Spirits and Arterial Bloud, as out of their proper matter. And the place wherein, or the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument that elaborates them, is not the Ve≈ø≈øels, but the very ≈øub≈øtance of the Brain, into who≈øe parenchyma or marrowy ≈øub≈øtance the Bloud and Vital Spirits are extrava≈øated.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the manner how this Work is performed there are great controver≈øies among≈øt the Learned, and many arguments urged by each, which will be too tedious here to recite: I will therefore give you onely the opinion of a late Worthy Authour as delivered in his own words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The Heart, ≈øays he, is like the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of the Body, to which the motion of all the Humours that have once pa≈øt it, is owing. This by its <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> impells the Bloud as into all other Parts, ≈øo into the Brain, by the ≈øeveral branches of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> who≈øe innumerable twigs run partly through the outer <hi>cortex</hi> or greyi≈øh part of the Brain, and partly into the inner medullar or white ≈øub≈øtance of it. The≈øe twigs of Arteries ≈øpring partly from the <hi>Plexus Choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Carotides</hi> them≈øelves immediately. The ≈øuperfluous <hi>≈øerum</hi> of the Bloud is ≈øeparated by the Glands before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57416:88"/>and that Bloud which is not elaborated into Animal Spirits, is returned again to the Heart by the Veins. But tho≈øe particles that are fit and proper to be converted into them, are extrava≈øated into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parenchyma of the Brain, or at lea≈øt are di≈øtributed through it by invi≈øible capillaries, in which being perfected into Spirits, the≈øe by the help of the Fibres or Filaments which the inner part or ≈øub≈øtance of the Brain chiefly con≈øi≈øts of, are conveyed into the <hi>Corpora ≈øtriata</hi> (or other Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>medulla oblongata</hi> that adhere to the Brain) which con≈øi≈øt of the like Filaments, and by them to the Nerves, who≈øe inner ≈øub≈øtance is fibrous like the <hi>medulla</hi> from whence they ≈øpring. And the rea≈øon of this ≈øucce≈ø≈øive motion from one to another, is the pul≈øe of the Heart, whereby that which comes behind always drives forward what is before. Whence (≈øays my Authour) the true cau≈øe of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy (wherein motion and ≈øen≈øe are almo≈øt quite aboli≈øhed) is from the ob≈øtruction or compre≈ø≈øion of the Arteries of the Brain: whereby both little Bloud and Vital Spirits can be conveyed thither to make Animal Spirit of; and al≈øo when it is made, it is not impelled out of the Brain along the Fibres into the Nerves, to enable them to perform their functions.</q> The≈øe are the words of that worthy Authour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Work.</p>
                        <p>It remains now to inquire how the≈øe Spirits, after they are thus elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do perpetually flow from the Brain through the pa≈ø≈øages of the Nerves, and how they enter and fill the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Fibres of which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ≈øen≈øitive Parts con≈øi≈øt.</p>
                        <p>That the Brain and Cerebel are the fir≈øt fountain of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits I have in my foregoing Di≈øcour≈øe already ≈øhewed; from whence they flow along the Nerves as by ≈øo many rivulets unto differing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Parts; till at length they pa≈øs out of the mo≈øt capillary Nerves into the ≈ømall Fibres interwoven in the Membranes, the mu≈øculous Fle≈øh, and other Parts, and la≈øt of all into the tendons of the Mu≈øcles, making them the organs of Sen≈øe and Motion: in which Parts becoming more fixed, they are called the <hi>implanted</hi> Spirits, attending their office when≈øoever the Nerves with their <hi>influent</hi> Spirits bring from the Brain the in≈øtinct for performing the ≈øame.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the≈øe <hi>nervous Fibres</hi> in their ≈øeveral Parts, which are the immediate in≈øtruments of the Animal Faculty, we ought to inquire from whence they have their ri≈øe: It is plain they do not ari≈øe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Head, or any of its marrowy Parts; neither can we rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably judge them to ≈øpring from the Nerves, becau≈øe the Fibres in mo≈øt Parts do much exceed the bulk or bigne≈øs of the Nerve that is brought to them, as may be ea≈øily ≈øeen by the tendon of every Mu≈øcle, which being made up of united Fibres, is ob≈øerved to be far greater than the Nerve that is in≈øerted into the Mu≈øcle: ≈øo that it is unlikely they ≈øhould be onely continued portions of the Nerves divided or jagged into fine threds, as ≈øome have imagined; and it is more probable that they are ≈øpermatick and primigenial Parts, that is, that the rudiments of them were drawn in the fir≈øt formation of the Parts of the Embryo in the Womb, as well and as ≈øoon as the Nerves them≈øelves; unle≈øs one would with Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> except the Fibres of the ≈øanguineous Parts, which he thinks to be bred ≈øecondarily of the Bloud and nervous Juice flowing into tho≈øe Parts.</p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57416:89"/>
                        <p>One thing further we mu≈øt note concerning the≈øe Fibres, that they are enabled to perform their motion, not onely from the Animal Spirits that flow by the Nerves at the in≈øtant of ≈øuch motion, but al≈øo from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are ≈øtored up in the Fibres them≈øelves; of which any one may ≈øatisfy him≈øelf in ob≈øerving an Animal newly killed when its Skin is taken off; for when life is peri≈øhed, and all the force of the Spirits flowing in through the Nerves hath quite cea≈øed, yet the Spirits implanted in the≈øe Fibres breaking forth from the Mu≈øcles ≈øtill move and ≈øhake them, and force them into ≈øeveral convul≈øions and trembling motions. This I have not onely ≈øeen my ≈øelf in ≈øeveral Hor≈øes I have cau≈øed to be killed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to di≈ø≈øect, but have al≈øo ≈øhewed it to ≈øeveral Spectators who have been very much plea≈øed at the ob≈øervation, and at the variety of their motions.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The fir≈øt pair of Nerves, viz. the Smelling. The ≈øecond pair, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves. The third pair, or Eye-movers. </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING ≈øufficiently treated of the Brain and Animal Faculty or Spirits, it is fit that in the next place I ≈øhould come to ≈øpeak of the Nerves, beginning according to the order of di≈ø≈øection with tho≈øe that ari≈øe immediately from the Brain, which I find to be of the ≈øame number in Hor≈øes as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath ob≈øerved them to be in Humane Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> nine pair. I will therefore ob≈øerve the ≈øame method, and begin as the ≈øaid Learned Doctor hath done, with the <hi>≈ømelling Nerves</hi> fir≈øt, becau≈øe they are the foremo≈øt, and therefore do fir≈øt appear in di≈ø≈øection.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Nerves are called the <hi>mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi>becau≈øe they are round at their end like a Pap. They take their ri≈øe from the ≈øhanks of the <hi>medulla oblongata</hi> betwixt the <hi>corpora ≈øtriata</hi> or chamfered Bodies, and the chambers of the Optick Nerves; from whence running under the bottom of the Brain they do in their cour≈øe by degrees increa≈øe, and become broader and larger, and at length reach as far as the Sieve-like Bone that is ≈øeated at the top of the No≈øtrils. During all which way they are ≈øoft and marrowy, (being hollow within and pretty full of moi≈øture) but being arrived at this Bone, they receive a new covering or coat from the <hi>dura mater,</hi> (being clad before onely with the <hi>pia mater</hi>) with which they are divided into many little Fibres or Filaments like little ≈øtrings, which do many of them pa≈øs through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the cavities of the No≈øtrils, where they are di≈øtributed on every ≈øide, entring into the Membranes that cover tho≈øe Parts. The≈øe Fibres or Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which do thus proceed from the before-named Proce≈ø≈øes, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the true organs of Smelling, and of Sen≈øation al≈øo. From whence it is that tho≈øe Per≈øons that do not accu≈øtom them≈øelves to draw ≈ønu≈øh up their No≈øes, are upon the lea≈øt ≈øcent of it provoked to ≈øneeze: which is occa≈øioned by the Powder's a≈øcending up the No≈øe and re≈øting upon the tender Membranes thereof, wherein the little Fibres of the ≈ømel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57416:90"/>Nerves being di≈øper≈øed, are immediatly irritated or provoked into a convul≈øive motion, which is that we call ≈øneezing. It was an old opinion that the Snivel was milked as it were out of the Ventricles of the Brain by the≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes; but having above in the fifth Chapter ≈øhewn other Ve≈ø≈øels which di≈øcharge that flegmatick matter into the No≈øe, namely the Arteries, it ≈øeems more probable that the≈øe Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes have a nobler u≈øe, namely <hi>that</hi> we have a≈øcribed unto them, to be the in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ≈ømelling. And therefore they are larger in Hor≈øes and all ≈øorts of Cattle than in Men, becau≈øe it was nece≈ø≈øary their Smell ≈øhould be very exqui≈øite, ≈øeeing they can di≈øtingui≈øh of the whol≈øomne≈øs or hurtfulne≈øs of their Food by that Sen≈øe onely.</p>

                        <p>The≈øe Nerves after they are thus united, do ≈øoon after again ≈øeparate, and go out of the Skull into the centre of the Eyes, three of who≈øe coats are made out of the ≈øub≈øtance of the≈øe Nerves being dilated.</p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:57416:91"/>
                        <p>At their ri≈øe and a pretty way in their progre≈øs they are very ≈øoft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered onely with the <hi>pia mater;</hi> but as ≈øoon as they reach the <hi>dura mater;</hi> they are covered with <hi>it</hi> al≈øo, and thereby become ≈øtronger and harder. This outmo≈øt Membrane it is which doth con≈øtitute that coat of the Eye called the horney Coat or <hi>≈øclerotica;</hi> and from the inner or <hi>pia mater</hi> doth proceed the next Coat or Skin of the Eye called <hi>uvea</hi> or Grape like, from its colour; and la≈øtly the marrowy ≈øub≈øtance of the Nerve doth make the third Coat called <hi>Retina</hi> or Net-like.</p>
                        <p>The Sen≈øe of <hi>Seeing</hi> like that of <hi>Smelling</hi> is by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> ≈øaid to be performed not ≈øo much by the help of the Nerve, as of the Fibres which are interwoven with the Organ; namely, ≈øaith he, the little Fibres in the Coats of the Eyes, and e≈øpecially tho≈øe that are in≈øerted into the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> or ≈øclerotick Coat, and di≈øpo≈øed after the manner of a Net, do receive the impre≈ø≈øion of the vi≈øible ≈øpecies, and by repre≈øenting the image of the thing ≈øo as it is offered without, cau≈øe ≈øight: but it is the office of the Nerve it ≈øelf to tran≈ømit inwardly, as it were by the pa≈ø≈øage of an Optick Tube, that image or ≈øen≈øible ≈øpecies, and to carry it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øen≈øory.</p>
                        <p> The next pair are the <hi>Eye-movers,</hi> which are by Ancient Authours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair, but do by our Modern Authours go for the <hi>third</hi> pair.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe take their beginning from the ba≈øis or bottom of the <hi>medulla ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longata</hi> behind the <hi>Funnel,</hi> from whence they proceed forwards by the ≈øides of the Optick Nerves. At their ri≈øe they are united, whence is a rea≈øon drawn that when one Eye is moved toward any object, the other is directed al≈øo towards the ≈øame.</p>
                        <p>They are ≈ømaller, yet much harder than the former, and as was ≈øaid, run along by their ≈øides untill they come to the <hi>os cuneiforme</hi> or Wedge-like Bone; where, as the Optick Nerves pa≈ø≈øed through the fir≈øt, ≈øo the≈øe pa≈øs through the ≈øecond hole of that Bone, and ≈øo on untill they come to the Mu≈øcles of the Eyes, into ≈øeveral if not all of which they ≈øend a twig or ≈ømall branch, which is in each Mu≈øcle ≈øubdivided into innumerable other ≈ømaller ones, by which the Animal Spirits are conveyed into the Fibres of the Mu≈øcles, and by con≈øequence the ≈øeveral motions of the Eye come to be performed, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed at large in a more convenient place, when I come to treat of the Mu≈øcles of the Eyes in the next Book.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the fourth and fifth pair of Nerves that ari≈øe within the Skull.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The fourth pair called Pathetick. The fifth pair. The rea≈øon of blu≈øhing.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>fourth</hi> pair of Nerves do ari≈øe contrary to all other: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the re≈øt do take their ri≈øe from the bottom or ≈øides of the oblong Marrow, the≈øe have their beginning at the top of it, behind tho≈øe round bunchings out of the Brain called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Te≈øtes,</hi> (of which we have already treated where we de≈øcribed the Parts of the Brain.) From whence bending a little forwards by the ≈øides of the ≈øaid oblong Marrow, they are immediately hid by the <hi>dura mater,</hi> under which they run for ≈øome time, untill they come to that hole of the Skull, where the other Nerves de≈øigned for the Eyes do pa≈øs out, which the≈øe accompany, but do not unite with, and at length terminate in the Trochlear Mu≈øcles of the Eyes.</p>
                        <p>This pair of Nerves are by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> called the <hi>Pathetick Nerves,</hi> becau≈øe, ≈øays he, their office is to move the Eyes <hi>pathetically,</hi> according to the force of the <hi>pa≈ø≈øions</hi> and <hi>in≈øtincts of Nature,</hi> delivered and remanded from the Brain to the After-brain, and on the contrary from this to that, through the <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Te≈øtes</hi> and their Medullar Proce≈ø≈øes. For, ≈øaith that Learned Anatomi≈øt, ≈øeeing that by the diver≈øe impul≈øe and undulation of the Animal Spirit's dwelling in this by-path, there happen certain mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual commerces between the Brain and <hi>Praecordia</hi> (the Cerebel media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between either, from who≈øe Ring-like Proce≈øs he will have the Nerves of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> to ari≈øe;) it is nece≈ø≈øary that the≈øe Nerves that are rooted in the middle way, ≈øhould be ≈øtruck upon by every march or remove of the Spirits going this way or that way, whereby the motions of the Eyes mu≈øt needs follow the affections of tho≈øe Parts. With the≈øe Nerves, (≈øaith he) all perfect Animals are furni≈øhed, there being none but are obnoxious to anger, love, hatred, and other Affections, as may be di≈øcovered in every little Creature, but much more in this which we are a di≈øcour≈øing of, there being none the a≈øpect and ge≈øture of who≈øe Eyes do ≈øhew them more than a Hor≈øe's do.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to treat of the fifth pair, concerning the ri≈øe of which there are ≈øeveral di≈øputes among≈øt Authours, (Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> particularly, affirming that they ≈øpring from the Ring-like Proce≈øs of the Cerebel:) but if their original be ≈øtrictly inquired into, I cannot find, in an Hor≈øe, (however it may be in Humane Brains) but that they do take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning as the others do, I mean from the oblong Marrow, onely a little below the former pair.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe con≈øi≈øt of very many Fibres gathered together, ≈øome of which are ≈øoft, and ≈øome hard; ≈øo that they ≈øeem not to be ≈øo much one ≈øingle pair of Nerves, as a collection of many ≈ømall Nerves into one bundle, ≈øome of which are de≈øigned for one u≈øe and ≈øome for another, being for that purpo≈øe di≈øtributed into ≈øeveral Parts remote one from another; in which they ≈øerve, in ≈øome for motion, in others for ≈øen≈øe: from whence it is, ≈øaith Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> that there is that ≈øympathy and con≈øent of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57416:92"/>actions in tho≈øe ≈øeveral Parts to which the≈øe Nerves are di≈øtributed. As for in≈øtance, ≈øeeing ≈øome twigs go to the Eyes, others to the Palate of the Mouth, No≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore when we ≈øee or ≈ømell what plea≈øes our Palate, our Mouth waters, as we commonly phra≈øe it.</p>
                        <p>But that it may be better under≈øtood what and how many Parts have con≈øent by means of the≈øe Nerves, it will be convenient to di≈øcover their divi≈øion, progre≈øs and different in≈øertion. Their Trunks, beginning or ari≈øing out of the oblong Marrow, as hath been ≈øhewed, are divided each of them into two notable branches, the fir≈øt whereof tending ≈øtreight <hi>downwards,</hi> and going out of the Skull by their proper holes, are in their de≈øcent towards the lower Jaw, (for who≈øe Parts, ≈øaith my Authour, they are chiefly de≈øign'd) divided into many le≈ø≈øer branches, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Temporal Mu≈øcles, as al≈øo for the Mu≈øcles of the Face and Cheeks. From the≈øe branches al≈øo there go twigs or little ≈øhoots into the Lips, Gums, roots of the Teeth, Jaws, Throat, and to the farther end of the Palate, and al≈øo to the Tongue.</p>
                        <p>The other branches of this pair of Nerves are called the <hi>≈øuperiour</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permo≈øt branches, being larger than the other, and do thus run their cour≈øe. After their divi≈øion from the former they go ≈øtreight forward for a little ≈øpace under the <hi>dura mater</hi> nigh the ≈øide of the Bone called the Turkey chair, and over again≈øt the <hi>glandula pituitaria</hi> ≈øend little twigs to the Trunk of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> that makes the <hi>wonderfull Net:</hi> then they are inoculated into the Nerves of the ≈øixth pair, and from thence ≈øend back ≈øometimes one, ≈øometimes two ≈øhoots a-piece, which being united with two other ≈ølips turned back from the Nerves of the ≈øixth pair, do con≈øtitute the root or fir≈øt trunk of the interco≈øtal pair of Nerves, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for the ninth pair, of which more ≈øhall be ≈øpoken by and by in the tenth Chapter.</p>
                        <p>After they have ≈øent out the ≈ølips for the root of the Interco≈øtal Nerve, the≈øe ≈øame great branches of the fifth pair are again divided each into two notable branches; the <hi>le≈ø≈øer</hi> and upper of which tends towards the globe of the Eye, and being again divided ≈øends forth two other, the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is parted into two more, that go, one, to the No≈øe, and the other to the Eye-lids; and the <hi>≈øecond</hi> into four or five ≈ølips, that are mo≈øtly ≈øpent on the Eye-lids, but partly on the Coats of the Eye and its Glands.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond or <hi>greater</hi> branch of the ≈øecond divi≈øion of the≈øe Nerves, being carried towards the orbit of the Eye, is again divided into two new branches: the <hi>lower</hi> of the≈øe being bent downwards, and cleaving it ≈øelf into many ≈øhoots, is be≈øtowed on the Palate and upper region of the Jaws; the other, being the <hi>higher,</hi> is carried beyond the orbit of the Eye, and pa≈ø≈øeth through a proper hole of the upper Jaw with the Vein and Artery which it twi≈øts about, and ≈øends many ≈ølips to the Mu≈øcles of the Cheeks, Lips, No≈øe, and roots of the upper Teeth.</p>
                        <p>From this pair of Nerves being di≈øtributed to ≈øo many Parts, I ≈øay, may the con≈øent of tho≈øe Parts one with another be learned: and particularly this is worthy ob≈øervation, That ≈øeeing they twi≈øt about the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels that go to the Cheeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hence it is, that when in Men and Women the Animal Spirits are di≈øturbed by the imagination of ≈øome uncomely thing; as if they took care to hide the Face, they enter the≈øe Nerves di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, whereby their twigs that embrace the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs and pull them, ≈øo that the Bloud comes to flow too impetuou≈øly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cheeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Arteries, and is detained there for ≈øome time
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57416:93"/>by ≈øtraitning the Veins. But ≈øuch ob≈øervations belong more to an Anatomi≈øt of Humane Bodies to which they are proper, and therefore I ≈øhall return from this digre≈ø≈øion, which yet, I hope, will not be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant to the inqui≈øitive Reader.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the ≈øixth and ≈øeventh pair of Nerves ari≈øing within the Skull.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The ≈øixth pair. The ≈øeventh pair, or Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nerves.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THOSE Nerves which are by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> reckoned for the <hi>≈øixth</hi> pair, are in the next place to be ≈øpoken to. The≈øe take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ju≈øt by the fifth, and being for a little time hid under the <hi>dura mater,</hi> go at length out of the ≈øame hole of the Skull with the before-named fourth and fifth pairs, and are carried each with a ≈øingle Trunk nigh to the Sockets of the Eyes; but ≈øo, that near the ≈øide of the Turky-chair-bone they are inoculated with the ≈øecond or greater branches of the fifth pair. Whence they ≈øend back ≈øometimes one, ≈øometimes two twigs, which being united with the fir≈øt or recurring branches of the fifth pair, as was noted in the foregoing Chapter, do con≈øtitute the beginning of the Interco≈øtal Nerves. Afterward going a little forwards, each of them near the Orbit or Socket of the Eye, is divided into two branches; one of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted into the Abducent Mu≈øcle of the Eye (or the Mu≈øcle that draws the Eye outward) which is ≈øeated in its outer corner; and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øplit into very many Fibres is be≈øtowed on the ≈øeventh Mu≈øcle of the Eye, which is ≈øaid to be proper onely to Brutes. Whether Men do wholly want them, let others examine; however, in the Animal we are treating of, they are very con≈øpicuous and mo≈øt ea≈øie to be found, concerning who≈øe u≈øe I will ≈øpeak when I come to a proper place for that purpo≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Next are the <hi>≈øeventh</hi> pair to be examined, which by the Ancients (and by all untill Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> altered the account) were reckoned for the fifth pair. The≈øe are employed about the Sen≈øe of <hi>Hearing,</hi> and are therefore called the <hi>Auditory</hi> Nerves. They take their ri≈øe in Humane Bodies (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Doctor <hi>Willis</hi>) out of the lower ≈øide of the Annular or ringy protuberance of the Cerebel; but I am ≈øure they do not ≈øo in Hor≈øes, in whom I have always found them to ari≈øe from the ≈øides of the oblong Marrow.</p>
                        <p>They have each of them two <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi> one ≈øoft and the other harder; which di≈øtinction of them makes many be of the opinion that they are indeed two pair of Nerves, though u≈øually they are accounted but for one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øofte≈øt</hi> of the≈øe two Proce≈ø≈øes is properly called the <hi>Auditory Nerve,</hi> the which is carried through an hole of <hi>os Petro≈øum</hi> (or the craggy Bone) into the Cells of the Ear, which it cloaths with a mo≈øt thin Membrane, and by which the ≈øounds are conveyed to the common Sen≈øory.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>harder</hi> part or proce≈øs of the Nerve is ≈øaid to conduce more to Motion than Sen≈øe; which pa≈ø≈øing out al≈øo through its proper hole in the afore≈øaid Bone doth immediately receive a twig from the eighth or wandring pair; after which it is ≈øtreight divided into two branches; the fir≈øt of which tending downward is be≈øtowed on the Mu≈øcles of the Tongue and the Bone <hi>Hyoides;</hi> the other winding about the auditory pa≈ø≈øage and bending more upwards, is divided into <hi>three</hi> Shoots; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which an≈øwering to the Nerve of the former divi≈øion, be≈øtows certain
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57416:94"/>≈ølips on the Mu≈øcles of the Lips, Mouth, Face and No≈øe, and ≈øo actuates ≈øome of the outward organs of the Voice, as the former doth ≈øome of the inner. The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the≈øe Shoots being divided into many other le≈ø≈øer, is ≈øent into the Mu≈øcles of the Forehead, as al≈øo to the Eye-lids. And the <hi>third</hi> or la≈øt of them doth run towards and ≈øpreads it ≈øelf into the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Ears. Whence upon any unu≈øual and a≈øtoni≈øhing ≈øound the Ear is by a natural in≈øtinct prickt up, to li≈øten to it the more attentively, and at the ≈øame time the Spirits flowing by other branches of this Nerve into the Mu≈øcles of the Eye-lids, cau≈øe them to be drawn as far a≈øunder as is po≈ø≈øible, that the Bea≈øt may have the clearer view of any threatning danger; which po≈øture of the Eyes we call <hi>≈øtaring.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the eighth and ninth pair of Nerves.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The eighth or wandring pair. The ninth or interco≈øtal pair.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE next pair of Nerves we are to treat of are the <hi>eighth,</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckoned for the <hi>≈øixth</hi>) otherwi≈øe called the <hi>wandring pair,</hi> from their being di≈øtributed into many Parts, wandring as it were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Head and Neck, but through many of the inferiour Parts of the Body both in the Che≈øt and Paunch, furni≈øhing them with nerves branching from them.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Nerves do al≈øo ari≈øe out of the oblong Marrow a little below the Auditory Nerves. Their root or beginning con≈øi≈øts of many Fibres, ≈øome of which are ≈ømaller and ≈øome thicker, to which is added a notable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre or rather Nerve, much greater than the re≈øt, coming from the Spinal Marrow of the Neck, which is joined with them and wrapped about with one and the ≈øame Coat taken from the <hi>dura mater,</hi> as if they were but one Nerve. They continue to be thus united till they have pa≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Skull, after which they are di≈øper≈øed to ≈øeveral Parts. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øory Nerve is di≈øtributed to the Mu≈øcles of the Neck and Shoulders; and one notable Fibre of the eighth pair joins it ≈øelf on each ≈øide to the harder Proce≈øs of the Auditory or ≈øeventh pair, as al≈øo two others run to the Mu≈øcles of the Gullet and Neck. But the re≈øt of the Fibres of the wandring pair continue together, going forward in one Trunk; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of the other companion lately parted from them (I mean the Spinal or Acce≈ø≈øory Nerve) they entertain a new one, which is the Interco≈øtal, or Nerve of the ninth pair.</p>
                        <p>In this place where the ≈øaid Interco≈øtal Nerve is united with this Nerve of the eighth pair, there is made a notable <hi>Plexus,</hi> (that is, the Trunk of the Nerve in that place ≈øwells into a kind of tumour, re≈øembling the joint or knot of a Cane.) For as the Interco≈øtal Nerve is received <hi>into</hi> it, ≈øo <hi>out</hi> of it there ≈øprings a con≈øiderable branch, which being carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Throttle is divided into three twigs; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is ≈øtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out into the ≈øphincter of the Gullet; the <hi>≈øecond</hi> being hid under the Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, di≈øtributes its Shoots to the upper Mu≈øcles of the Throttle, and particularly to the Mu≈øcle by which the Chink of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57416:95"/>Throttle is ≈øhut up. The <hi>third</hi> of the≈øe ≈øhoots or twigs going al≈øo under the Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, meets the top of the Recurring Nerve and is united with the ≈øame.</p>
                        <p>Below the afore≈øaid inoculating of the Interco≈øtal with the wandring pair, which makes that <hi>Plexus</hi> before named, the Trunk of this latter goes ≈øtreight down by the ≈øides of the a≈øcending Carotid Artery, on which it be≈øtows ≈øome ≈ølips, and at the bottom of the Neck it ≈øends out another twig into the Recurrent Nerve, but this it does onely on the left ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>From hence the Trunk of the wandring pair de≈øcends without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted branchings till it comes over again≈øt the fir≈øt or ≈øecond Rib, where out of a ≈øecond <hi>Plexus</hi> many ≈øhoots and numerous Fibres are ≈øent forth towards the Heart and its appendages, but not altogether in the ≈øame manner on both ≈øides. Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> ≈øays, many more branches are ≈øent from this pair towards the Heart in Bea≈øts than in Men; for in the≈øe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there are a great many twigs ≈øent thereto from the Interco≈øtal pair, whereas there are very few in Brutes; ≈øo that in both, the plenty of the one ≈øupplies the defect of the other.</p>
                        <p>There is (≈øaith the ≈øame Authour) one notable difference worthy of note, of the two Recurrent Nerves that ≈øpring out of the Trunk of this eighth pair, <hi>viz.</hi> that that on the right ≈øide ari≈øes out of it higher, and winds about the Axillar Artery; whereas that on the left ≈øprings much lower therefrom, and twi≈øting about the de≈øcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> returns back from thence, and a≈øcends upwards where in its progre≈øs it ≈øends forth ≈øhoots to divers Parts.</p>
                        <p>And that ob≈øervation of the ≈øaid Doctor is worthy to be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Nerves that pa≈øs towards the Heart of Brutes are much fewer in number than tho≈øe in Men, of which (as al≈øo of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chiefly from the wandring pair) he gives this ingenious rea≈øon; That ≈øeeing Bea≈øts want prudence, and are not much liable to various and divers pa≈ø≈øions, it was not therefore nece≈ø≈øary that there ≈øhould be two ways of deriving the Spirits from the Brain to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to bring Spirits to maintain the exerci≈øe of the vital function, and the other to mini≈øter to the impre≈ø≈øions of the affections; but it is ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that all the Spirits, for what≈øoever office they are de≈øtin'd, ≈øhould be conveyed thither by one and the ≈øame path.</p>
                        <p>Over again≈øt the Heart, the <hi>Trunk</hi> of the wandring pair ≈øends forth many notable branches on either hand, which pa≈ø≈øing to the Lungs, are di≈øtributed through their whole ≈øub≈øtance along with the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels and branches of the Wind-pipe, which they climb upon and twi≈øt about: and as it de≈øcends by the ≈øides of the Wind-pipe, it di≈øtributes al≈øo many ≈ølips into the Coats of the Gullet. After the≈øe branches have grown out of the≈øe Nerves, then is each Trunk, as it de≈øcends by the Gullet, divided into an <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner</hi> branch: but pre≈øently the outer branches unite with the outer, and the inner with the inner; and being ≈øo united, the <hi>former</hi> de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends by the out≈øide of the orifice of the Stomach to its bottom, where it di≈øper≈øes it ≈øelf; and the <hi>latter</hi> de≈øcending by the in≈øide of the orifice of the Stomach, turns back there, and creeps along its upper part. To what other Parts the twigs of this eighth or wandring pair are extended, the Reader may learn in the de≈øcription of the Parts them≈øelves, in treating of which we have con≈øtantly ob≈øerv'd to ≈øhew from whence their Nerves were derived.</p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57416:95"/>
                        <p>After the <hi>wandring</hi> or <hi>eighth</hi> pair, by order of di≈ø≈øection the <hi>ninth</hi> and la≈øt pair of Nerves that ≈øpring from within the Skull are to be ≈øpoken to. Concerning the ri≈øe of which pair, there are various opinions; for ≈øome there be that will have them onely branches of the wandring pair, and that they take their beginning from them: but that opinion is rejected, ≈øince it is now made very apparent that they have another original, of which the often before-cited Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> was the fir≈øt di≈øcoverer, whom I may be bold to follow, ≈øince none have given, nor 'tis probable can give a better account of them than that Learned man, who ≈øaith that the beginnings, (as al≈øo the different Trunks in the progre≈øs) of the≈øe Interco≈øtal Nerves are ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øhed from the former, notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they do often communicate or join together by branches ≈øent forth from one to the other.</p>
                        <p>But though they owe not their original to the wandring pair, and much le≈øs are to be reputed as branches of them, yet have they no proper root of their own, but do borrow their original from two or three recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring branches of the fifth and ≈øixth pairs near their origine, growing out of them as a Shrub upon another Tree or Shrub.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Nerves thus con≈øtituted do afterward run out of the Skull by their proper holes, and pre≈øently on each ≈øide form a <hi>Plexus</hi> near that of the wandring pair, into which two Nervous Proce≈ø≈øes out of the fir≈øt vertebral pair are in≈øerted, and out of which there goes one twig or ≈ølip into the Sphincter of the Gullet, and another into the <hi>Plexus</hi> afore≈øaid of the wandring pair. Whence de≈øcending by the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, by that time they arrive at its middle, they have each another greater <hi>Plexus,</hi> into which a large Nerve from a neighbouring vertebral pair is in≈øerted, and from which proceed ≈øome twigs that uniting with others of the wandring pair are di≈øtributed all about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (that is, to the Heart and Lungs) as al≈øo one ≈øingle one a little lower. 'Tis true, Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> affirms that this <hi>Plexus</hi> la≈øt ≈øpoken of is <hi>proper to Man onely;</hi> but ≈øince I find ≈øo little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the other Parts between a Man and the Animal I am treating of, I ≈øu≈øpend my belief whether this <hi>Plexus</hi> may not be found in him al≈øo, though I have not been yet ≈øo diligent as to make any exact inquiry into it.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Plexus</hi> is called the <hi>Plexus cervicalis,</hi> becau≈øe it is formed in the Neck; whence the Trunks of this Interco≈øtal pair de≈øcending by the <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viculae</hi> or Chanel-bones into the Che≈øt, as ≈øoon as they have arrived at the ≈øecond Rib, each of them receives three or four branches from the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bral Nerves next above, whereby is made another notable <hi>Plexus,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Interco≈øtal. From whence as its Trunks pa≈øs down by the roots of the Ribs, in every one of their Inter≈øtices, and even as low as the <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> from every jointing of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> each Trunk receives a Vertebral Nerve.</p>
                        <p>As ≈øoon as they are de≈øcended out of the Cavity of the Che≈øt, and are come over again≈øt the bottom of the Stomach, they ≈øend forth on each ≈øide a notable branch, each of which tending towards the Me≈øentery makes its chief <hi>Plexus's,</hi> being in number ≈øeven, <hi>viz.</hi> five large ones which are <hi>upper,</hi> and two le≈øs that are <hi>lower.</hi> For each branch is pre≈øently divided into two other, and every one forms one <hi>Plexus,</hi> which make four; and the fifth is in the middle of the≈øe, being the large≈øt: and the≈øe are the five <hi>upper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57416:96"/>
                        <p>The two <hi>lower Plexus</hi> are framed of two branches that ≈øpring from the Trunks de≈øcended as far as the lower part of the Loyns, and are di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed by the names of <hi>Plexus infimus,</hi> and <hi>minimus,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the lowe≈øt, and the lea≈øt) which two <hi>Plexus</hi> do furni≈øh ≈øeveral Parts of the Lower Belly with Nerves.</p>
                        <p>La≈øtly, When this Interco≈øtal pair have de≈øcended as low as the <hi>Os ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> and have furni≈øhed in their cour≈øe the ≈øeveral Parts of the Lower Belly with Nerves, they bend towards one another and ≈øeem to be knit together by two or three Proce≈ø≈øes, and at length each of them ends in ≈ømall Fibres which are di≈øtributed into the Sphincter Mu≈øcle of the Ar≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I given a de≈øcription of the ≈øeveral pairs of Nerves ari≈øing within the Skull, in de≈øcribing of which I mu≈øt own my ≈øelf obliged to ≈øeveral worthy Authours, who≈øe Doctrine I have been forced much to follow and relie on in this particular, having not as yet made a thorow in≈øpection into the≈øe mo≈øt curious In≈øtruments of the Animal Faculty my ≈øelf: the chiefe≈øt of which Authours and whom I have mo≈øt followed, is that accurate Tracer of them, Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> to whom all that have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the≈øe Parts ≈øince him, have been ≈øo much beholding. But onely where he a≈ø≈øigns ≈øome differences betwixt the cour≈øe of the Nerves in Men, and <hi>all</hi> Brutes <hi>in general,</hi> I cannot ea≈øily acquie≈øce in his opinion in relation to a Hor≈øe, the frame of who≈øe Body comes almo≈øt in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects ≈øo near to that of a Man's; however, till I have made a more exact ≈øcrutiny, I ≈øhall forbear contradiction.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Nerves ari≈øing from the Spinal Marrow, while it is in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Thirty ≈øeven pair of Nerves ≈øpring out of the Spinal Marrow. The fir≈øt pair of the Neck. The ≈øecond. The third and fourth. The fifth. The ≈øixth. The Acce≈ø≈øory Nerve, that a≈øcends to the Brain, and unites with the wandring pair.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING treated of the ≈øeveral Conjugations or Pairs of Nerves which take their beginning from that part of the Spinal Marrow contained <hi>within</hi> the Skull, the u≈øual and mo≈øt natural method requires me next to proceed to tho≈øe that ≈øpring from that part of it that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck and Chine without the Skull.</p>
                        <p>We ob≈øerved in a Chapter above, that in its whole progre≈øs from the Skull to the Rump-bones there ≈øpring from it thirty ≈øeven pair of Nerves. Particularly, while it is in the Neck, there ari≈øe out of it ≈øeven pair; while it is in the Back, ≈øeventeen pair; while it is in the Loyns, ≈øeven pair; and while it is in the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> ≈øix pair: for as was noted before, ≈øuch is the number of the Joints in the Rack-bone, betwixt every of which a pair of Nerves i≈ø≈øues. Of all which we will treat briefly in order.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair of the <hi>Neck,</hi> though it be commonly reckoned among the pairs of the Spine or Rack-bone, becau≈øe it comes out from between the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> and the Skull; yet if we con≈øider its ri≈øe, it ought rather to be reputed the <hi>tenth</hi> pair of the Brain; for it ri≈øes with many Fibres from the Spinal Marrow while it is yet within the Skull, but pre≈øently after its ri≈øe tends backwards or downwards (whereas all the re≈øt that ari≈øe within the Skull go forwards.) This pair is chiefly be≈øtowed on the Mu≈øcles of the Neck.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair comes out between the fir≈øt and ≈øecond <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and is be≈øtowed upon the Neck, Head and Face.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> pair come forth of the holes that are between the ≈øecond and third, and the third and fourth <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and are ≈øpread into the Mu≈øcles of the Cheeks, as al≈øo into the Mu≈øcles that are common to the Head and Neck.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> ≈øpringeth forth between the fourth and fifth <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> A twig from each Nerve of this pair, being joined with the like twigs of the fourth and ≈øixth, do make that remarkable Nerve that goes to the Midriff, and is called <hi>Nervus Phrenicus.</hi> The other branches of this fifth pair are di≈øtributed ≈øome of them backward and ≈øome forward into ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Mu≈øcles; ≈øome of which do bow the Head; other twigs run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Fore-legs, and are di≈øtributed into ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles about the Shoulders.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øixth</hi> pair cometh out under the fifth <hi>Vertebra,</hi> and hath, as the re≈øt, ≈øeveral branches; ≈øome of which go to the Mu≈øcles of the Fore-legs, and ≈øome to the Mu≈øcles of the Neck; but one particular twig helps to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57416:98"/>make up the Trunk of the <hi>Nervus Phrenicus,</hi> joining it ≈øelf with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid twigs of the fourth and fifth pairs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øeventh</hi> pair cometh out of the hole common to the ≈øixth and ≈øeventh <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> which joining with the foregoing pair, <hi>viz.</hi> the ≈øixth of the Neck, and likewi≈øe with the two following, <hi>viz.</hi> the two fir≈øt of the Che≈øt, is di≈øper≈øed into ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles of both the Shoulders, al≈øo to the Neck and Cheeks.</p>
                        <p>About where this ≈øeventh pair of Nerves ari≈øes, there ≈øprings another, found out by Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> and by him called <hi>Nervus ad par vagum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øorius,</hi> which a≈øcends up by the ≈øides of the Spinal Marrow (growing in its cour≈øe thicker and thicker) untill it reach up to the Skull, during which way it continues in one body without ≈øending any branches to any Part. When it has entred the Skull, it then joins it ≈øelf with the Fibres of the eighth pair of the Brain called the wandring pair, with which it takes its progre≈øs out of the Skull, but pre≈øently after ≈øeparates from them, and is di≈øper≈øed into the Mu≈øcles of the Neck and Shoulders, as was ≈øhewed before in the foregoing Chapter, while we di≈øcour≈øed of the wandring pair.</p>

                        </head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The fir≈øt pair of the Back. The ≈øecond pair. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifteen pair. The fir≈øt pair of the Loyns. The ≈øecond pair. The third pair. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four pair. The fir≈øt pair of Os ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five pair. How the Nerves ≈øpring out of the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>FROM the Marrow of the Back proceed ≈øeventeen pair of Nerves, there being in an Hor≈øe ≈øo many Spondyls or Back-bones; which number exceeds that of the Joints of the Back in Humane Bodies, there being in <hi>them</hi> but twelve, and ≈øo accordingly they have no more than twelve pair of Nerves from the Marrow within the Back.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the≈øe pairs ≈øpringeth out of the hole which is common to the la≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck and the fir≈øt of the Che≈øt: Each of them (as are likewi≈øe all the following) is pre≈øently divided into two branches, of which the <hi>formore</hi> is larger than the <hi>hinder.</hi> The <hi>formore</hi> joineth it ≈øelf with the two la≈øt of the Neck, and ≈øo goeth the greate≈øt part of it to the Fore-legs; onely one little twig that ari≈øeth out of it before ≈øuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, is be≈øtowed upon ≈øome of the Mu≈øcles of the Brea≈øt and Neck; and the ≈ømaller which is the <hi>hinder,</hi> is be≈øtowed upon the Mu≈øcles ≈øeated on the Back.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair ≈øprings out between the fir≈øt and ≈øecond <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt, who≈øe <hi>formore</hi> branch being united with the fir≈øt of the Che≈øt, together with it is joined with the ≈øixth and ≈øeventh of the Neck, which all together make one <hi>Plexus,</hi> out of which proceed mo≈øt of the Nerves that are in≈øerted into the Mu≈øcles of the Shoulders and Fore-legs. But before the afore≈øaid formore branch unite with the foregoing, it ≈øends forth a twig to the Interco≈øtal Nerve (or Nerve of the ninth pair) de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57416:98"/>down the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Che≈øt, as al≈øo do all the re≈øt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fifteen pair.</p>
                        <p>That branch of this pair which is called the <hi>hinder</hi> branch, hath the ≈øame di≈øtribution with the hinder of the foregoing pair, and therefore I will omit ≈øpeaking particularly of it: Neither do I think it nece≈ø≈øary to treat of every particular of the remaining pairs that proceed from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Back; fir≈øt, becau≈øe my de≈øign is to be as brief as po≈ø≈øible both in the≈øe and all other Parts, that I may not make my Volume ≈øwell too big; and in the next place, the remaining pairs coming out of the ≈øeveral holes betwixt the jointings of the other Bones of the Back as the≈øe already ≈øpoken of do out of the former, it would be but repeating almo≈øt the ≈øame things over again ≈øo to de≈øcribe particularly every pair. I will therefore onely ≈øpeak thus much of them in general, that after they are come out of their ≈øeveral holes of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> they do each of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately divide them≈øelves into two branches, whereof the <hi>formore</hi> (being, as hath been ≈øaid, the larger) ≈øends one twig to the Interco≈øtal Nerve, and the remainder of it is be≈øtowed on the Mu≈øcles between the Ribs, called the Interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles, both external and internal, and a few twigs al≈øo upon the other Mu≈øcles of the Che≈øt that lie upon the Ribs; and la≈øtly, a twig or two on the obliquely de≈øcending Mu≈øcles of the Lower Belly. The <hi>hinder</hi> and le≈ø≈øer branches pre≈øently upon the divi≈øion bend backward to the Spine, and are ≈øpent upon the Mu≈øcles and Skin of the Back.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to ≈øpeak to tho≈øe Nerves that ≈øpring from that part of the Spinal Marrow that is contained within the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Loyns,</hi> which are in number ≈øeven pair according to the number of Bones in that Part. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which cometh out between the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Loyns and the la≈øt of the Back. Each of them, like tho≈øe of the Back, is pre≈øently divided into two branches; the <hi>formore</hi> of which is be≈øtowed upon the fle≈øhy part of the Midriff, e≈øpecially its two Proce≈ø≈øes, and partly on the Mu≈øcle <hi>P≈øoas;</hi> and the <hi>hinder</hi> of them is in≈øerted into the <hi>Mu≈øculus longi≈ø≈øimus</hi> or longe≈øt Mu≈øcle of the Back.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair come out between the fir≈øt and ≈øecond <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns under the Mu≈øcle <hi>P≈øoas;</hi> the <hi>formore</hi> of who≈øe branches is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed upon the Mu≈øcle that fills up the Cavity of <hi>Os Ileum</hi> or Haunch-bone (which Mu≈øcle is the ≈øecond bender of the Thigh) al≈øo a twig of it is ≈øent to the <hi>Mu≈øculus fa≈øcialis,</hi> and to other neighbouring Parts. The <hi>hinder</hi> branch pa≈ø≈øeth into the Buttock Mu≈øcles, and doth lo≈øe it ≈øelf in the bodies of tho≈øe Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair of the≈øe Nerves of the Loyns come forth between the ≈øecond and third <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, from under the Mu≈øcle <hi>P≈øoas,</hi> as the former did. The <hi>fore</hi> branch is di≈øper≈øed down the hinder Leg to the Cambrel or Hock, furni≈øhing ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles about tho≈øe Parts with Nerves. The <hi>hinder</hi> branch is bent back and di≈øper≈øed through the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Loyns, ≈øupplying them with Nerves.</p>
                        <p>The other four pair of the≈øe Nerves of the Loyns, like the former, come forth from between the other four <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns. Their <hi>fore</hi> branches are di≈øper≈øed into mo≈øt of the Mu≈øcles of the Buttocks and hinder legs; al≈øo ≈øome twigs are ≈øent from them to the Mu≈øcles that rai≈øe the Yard, ≈øome others to the neck of the Bladder; and in Mares ≈øome twigs are ≈øent to the <hi>Matrix</hi> or Womb. And the <hi>hinder</hi> branches are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried backward, and are be≈øtowed upon ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles of the Back.</p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57416:99"/>
                        <p>In the next place I come to treat of the remaining Conjugations or pairs of Nerves that ≈øpring from the Spinal Marrow, which are tho≈øe that come forth of the holes of <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> and are in number ≈øix pair, there being in the ≈øaid Bone ≈øix <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> with pretty wide holes for the coming forth of the Nerves.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the≈øe pair i≈ø≈øueth out between the la≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Loyns and the fir≈øt of <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> in the ≈øame manner as tho≈øe that ≈øpring out of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and like them is divided into two branches; the <hi>foremo≈øt</hi> of which is a great part of it mixed with tho≈øe other of the <hi>Loyns,</hi> and with them runs down to the hinder Legs, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles of tho≈øe Parts with Nerves. And the <hi>hinder</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øheth the bigge≈øt Buttock-mu≈øcle and other Parts thereabouts with Nerves.</p>
                        <p>This pair of Nerves, as I have ≈øaid, come out ≈øide-ways like the Nerves of the Loyns, and are divided like them afterwards into a <hi>fore</hi> and a <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> branch; but the other five pair come out before and behind; but before they go out of the Bone, they are on each ≈øide double, and on each ≈øide one Nerve goes into the fore-parts and the other into the hinder. Tho≈øe that go into the hinder-parts are di≈øper≈øed as tho≈øe of the Loyns were, that is, into the Mu≈øcles that lie upon the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> and <hi>Ileum;</hi> but tho≈øe that go into the fore-parts are di≈øper≈øed into ≈øome Mu≈øcles on the fore-part of the Thigh; al≈øo ≈øome twigs of them are ≈øent to the Cods, the Bladder, and to the Mu≈øcles of the Fundament.</p>

                        <p>Thus have I given a brief de≈øcription of the ≈øeveral Conjugations or Pairs of Nerves that ≈øpring from the Spinal Marrow, ≈øhewing where they ari≈øe, which way they pa≈øs, and to what Parts they run; which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57416:100"/>may be of great u≈øe to our Practitioners, if they will but take the pains to inquire into this part of Anatomy; for by under≈øtanding the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or ri≈øe of the Nerve that furni≈øheth an affected Part, one may learn where to apply the Remedy. As for in≈øtance; When from any outward cau≈øe, as from a fall, ≈øtroke, brui≈øe or any other accident, any Part hath lo≈øt either Sen≈øe or Motion or both; or from any inward cau≈øe a Pal≈øie happens, by which the u≈øe of ≈øome particular Limb is taken away; it would conduce very much to the cure if the ri≈øe of the Nerves of ≈øuch Part were known by the undertaker of the cure of tho≈øe Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for the Medicine is to be applied always to the beginning or ri≈øe of that Nerve that pa≈ø≈øes to that Part, or as near to it as is po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhould here put an end to this di≈øcour≈øe of the Spinal Nerves, if it were not convenient to add a word of the manner how they ari≈øe out of the Marrow, which is very accurately de≈øcribed thus by Doctor <hi>Willis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>On each ≈øide of the Spinal Marrow, near its outer edge four or five Fibres ari≈øe in its upper ≈øide, and as many in its lower: both which companies penetrate fir≈øt the <hi>pia mater</hi> or inmo≈øt Coat of the Spinal Marrow, and then the <hi>dura mater</hi> or middle Coat, (which is as it were a common ca≈øe to them all) with <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> Fibres: but afterwards as both companies of Fibres are to pa≈øs through the third Membrane (for the Spinal Marrow has three) they meet together, and being inve≈øted with the Coat they borrowed from the ≈øecond Membrane, they become as it were one Trunk: which Trunk pa≈ø≈øing out of the jointing of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> is again divided into ≈øeveral Nerves de≈øign'd for ≈øundry Parts. After this manner in the whole tract of the Spinal Marrow have the ≈øeveral vertebral Nerves their origine; and in tho≈øe places where the brachial <hi>(or fore-leg)</hi> and crural Nerves pa≈øs out, the Spinal Marrow encrea≈øes both in thickne≈øs and breadth, and the nervous Fibres are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</q> All which that it may be the better apprehended, I have thought good to annex the following Figure from Him, onely encrea≈øing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the pairs of Nerves as they are found to be in an Hor≈øe.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Eyes, their name. Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Their figure. Their Parts. The Eye-lids. 1. The Tunicles of the Eyes. Adnata. 2. Sclerotica. 3. Choroides. 4. Retina. The Humours of the Eyes. The watery Humour. The Cry≈øtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line. The Gla≈ø≈øey.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Eyes</hi> are termed in Latin <hi>Oculi,</hi> from the word <hi>occludo</hi> to ≈øhut, or from <hi>occulto</hi> to hide, becau≈øe they are hid by the ≈øhutting of the Eye-lids. They are the Organs or In≈øtruments of Sight, con≈øi≈øting of many Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of Humours, Membranes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their <hi>number</hi> is by all People known to be two, and that for the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and perfection of ≈øight; that if one be defective, or ≈øhould by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be lo≈øt, the other may ≈øupply its place and office, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ≈øo perfectly.</p>
                        <p>The Eye alone, when its Mu≈øcles, and the Nerves and Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels that enter into it, are removed, is of a round figure, both that it might move the better, and al≈øo that it might the better receive the vi≈øible Rays.</p>
                        <p>Adjoining unto the Eyes are the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi> which contain them as it were, and ≈øerve as a ≈øafeguard or cover to pre≈øerve them from external injuries: United with them are the Fat and Mu≈øcles: and la≈øtly the Parts that con≈øtitute the Eye it ≈øelf are the Membranes, Humours, and Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eye-lids</hi> do ≈øerve as Curtains to the Eyes, by which du≈øt, Flies, or any thing el≈øe that might annoy them, is kept out. They are made up of the Skin, the <hi>membrana Carno≈øa</hi> or fle≈øhy Pannicle, and Mu≈øcles; but both the Mu≈øcles and fle≈øhy Pannicle are in the≈øe Parts very thin. On the in≈øide next the Eye they are lined with a Membrane that is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> which is very ≈ømooth, that it may move glib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Eye. The extremities or edges of the Eye-lids are hard and gri≈øtly, partly to ≈øtrengthen them, and partly that they may meet the more exactly, and not fall one over the other. And thus much ≈øhall ≈øuffice for the outward or containing Parts of the Eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eye-lids.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Mu≈øcles,</hi> we ≈øhall defer ≈øpeaking of them till the next Book. And as to the <hi>Fat,</hi> it differs not from that which is intermixed among the Mu≈øcles in other Parts, and ≈øerves here to keep the hinder-part of the Eye and parts adjoining moi≈øt, that the Eye may move the more glibly in its Socket.</p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:57416:101"/>
                        <p>We ≈øhall therefore next proceed to the Eye it ≈øelf, and de≈øcribe the Parts of which it con≈øi≈øts, and fir≈øt its Tunicles or Coats, the fir≈øt or outmo≈øt of which is a <hi>common</hi> Coat, ari≈øing from the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and is ≈øpread over all the white of the Eye. By this is the Eye kept firmly within its Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or Orbit. It is of exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe, and hath many ≈ømall Arteries and Veins creeping through it, which are very di≈øcernible when there is any inflammation in that Part. It is called <hi>Adnata.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Adnata</hi> being removed, the <hi>proper</hi> Tunicles or Coats do appear, being in number three; the fir≈øt of which from its hardne≈øs is called <hi>≈øcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotica.</hi> This ari≈øes from the <hi>dura mater,</hi> or (which is all one) from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Coat of the Optick Nerve. It is ≈øomewhat hard, and opaque on its back≈øide; but on its fore-part, becau≈øe it is tran≈øparent like an Horn, it lo≈øes its name of <hi>≈øclerotica</hi> which it had from its hardne≈øs, and is called <hi>tunica cornea</hi> or horney Coat from its clearne≈øs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> proper Coat lieth next under this, and goeth by the name of <hi>Choroides,</hi> becau≈øe it re≈øembles that Membrane that inwraps the Foal in the Womb, called <hi>Chorion.</hi> As the former did ari≈øe from the <hi>dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ≈øo doth this from the <hi>pia mater,</hi> (or if you will, from the inner Coat of the Optick Nerve.) All over the back-part of the Eye, this Coat on its in≈øide is blacki≈øh, that the Idea's received in might appear the more illu≈øtrious.</p>
                        <p>This Coat is perforated before as wide as the <hi>pupilla</hi> or ≈øight of the Eye is in compa≈øs, to permit the rays of vi≈øible Species to pa≈øs in to the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtalline Humour. Which fore-part, becau≈øe ≈øo much of it as is from under the white is ≈øomewhat of the colour of a Grape, is called <hi>uvea:</hi> by which name the fore-part of this Coat is di≈øtingui≈øhed from its hinder-part, as the former was by the name of <hi>cornea,</hi> from <hi>≈øclerotica;</hi> which I thought fit to take notice of in this place, that the Reader might not take the four names for four ≈øeveral Coats, when they are but two, and ≈øo might go about to find what indeed there is not.</p>
                        <p>From the circumference of the <hi>uvea,</hi> where its duplicated Membrane bends it ≈øelf back to the cry≈øtalline Humour, there is formed a Ligament called <hi>ligamentum Ciliare,</hi> becau≈øe it con≈øi≈øts of ≈ølender Filaments or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres like the hairs that grow upon the Eye-lids in Humane Bodies, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like ≈øo many black lines from the circumference of the <hi>uvea</hi> to the ≈øides of the cry≈øtalline Humour; which Humour they encompa≈øs, and widen or con≈øtringe it as there is occa≈øion, by contracting or opening the perforation of the <hi>uvea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> or inmo≈øt proper Tunicle of the Eye is called <hi>Retina</hi> or the Net-fa≈øhioned Coat, becau≈øe it encompa≈ø≈øes the vitreous or gla≈ø≈øey Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour like a Net.</p>
                        <p>This Coat is made of the medullar ≈øub≈øtance of the Optick Nerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very thin, and rather of a dark than light≈øom colour, mixed with an ob≈øcure redne≈øs. Its figure is ≈øemicircular, round on its out≈øide, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low within, containing in it the vitreous Humour, and receiving into its bo≈øom the cry≈øtalline Humour al≈øo, having its Fibres extended as far as the <hi>ligamentum Ciliare,</hi> to which the≈øe Fibres afford animal Spirits for the continuance of its motion. It is ob≈øerved that if this Coat be taken and put into warm Water, ≈øhaking it a little to wa≈øh off the mucous or ≈ønotty matter that cleaves to it, and then be held up to the light, the Fibres or Filaments will appear very numerous like the threads of the fine≈øt Lawn.</p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57416:102"/>
                        <p>Having done with the <hi>Tunicles</hi> or Coats of the Eyes, I come next to ≈øpeak of the <hi>Humours</hi> contained within tho≈øe Coats, which are in number three, that is the <hi>Aqueus</hi> or watery, the <hi>Vitreus</hi> or gla≈ø≈øey, and the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtalline: of which the la≈øt for its u≈øe is the mo≈øt noble, and is placed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt in the centre of the Eyes.</p>
                        <p>Of the≈øe Humours the <hi>Aqueus</hi> or <hi>watery</hi> is outermo≈øt, being thin and fluxive like Water, from whence it hath its name. It fills up that ≈øpace that is betwixt the horney or outmo≈øt Coat and the cry≈øtalline Humour in the fore-part of the Eye. It is ob≈øerved in Men, that if any clotted and coloured bits or motes ≈øwim in this Humour, the ≈øhapes of ≈øeveral In≈øects, as Gnats, Flies, Spiders and the like, will ≈øeem to be flying before their Eyes, as hath been oft declared by Men who have had this Affection. I am therefore apt to believe that many Hor≈øes are not without ≈øuch kind of congealed bits floating in this Humour, that without any evident or external cau≈øe to occa≈øion it, are much given to ≈øtart, e≈øpecially with their Head; the repre≈øentation of the afore≈øaid In≈øects moving before the cry≈øtalline Humour, which makes them fear ≈øomething or other is ≈øtill flying into their Eye.</p>
                        <p>Yea it is in Humane Bodies farther ob≈øerved, that oft times ≈øeveral of the≈øe coloured Particles in the watery Humour do gather together, and unite ≈øo clo≈øe, that they grow as it were into a skin or film, ≈øpreading before the ≈øight of the Eye, which cau≈øes an ab≈øolute blindne≈øs, and is that Di≈øea≈øe which Phy≈øicians call a <hi>Cataract;</hi> which Di≈øea≈øe the Animal we are treating of is much ≈øubject to, though we have not ≈øo proper a term for it as this is.</p>
                        <p>The next Humour is the <hi>Cry≈øtalline,</hi> which is ≈øo called from its excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bright and ≈øhining colour, being as tran≈øparent as Cry≈øtal; It is it ≈øelf of no di≈øtingui≈øhable colour, that it might receive the Idea's of all colours.</p>
                        <p>It is placed betwixt the watery and gla≈ø≈øey Humours, but not exactly in the middle or centre of the Eye, but rather towards its fore-part. It is inclo≈øed in the bo≈øom, as it were, of the gla≈ø≈øey Humour, and is flatti≈øh on the fore-≈øide, but rounder behind.</p>
                        <p>This Humour is believed to be the primary or chief in≈øtrument of the ≈øight, becau≈øe it collects or receives the rayes of vi≈øible things; though the <hi>tunica Retina</hi> doth afterwards ≈øtop them by its dark body, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to the common Sen≈øory by the Optick Nerve.</p>
                        <p>The third and la≈øt of the Humours of the Eye is the <hi>Vitreus</hi> or <hi>gla≈ø≈øey,</hi> ≈øo called becau≈øe in colour it is like to molten gla≈øs. This is not of ≈øo thick a con≈øi≈øtence as the cry≈øtalline; but it much exceeds both it and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in quantity. It is round in its hinder part but plane before, onely it has a little hollowne≈øs in the middle wherein the cry≈øtalline Humour is placed as in a mold or ca≈øe. It fills up all the hinder part of the globe of the Eye, as al≈øo ≈øome part of the ≈øides.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of this Humour are ≈øaid to be, fir≈øt, to nouri≈øh the cry≈øtalline Humour, as <hi>Galen</hi> conceived; next, that the vi≈øible ≈øpecies received into the cry≈øtalline Humour might not be reflected, or return defiled by dark and coloured tinctures, whereby the ≈øight ≈øhould be di≈øturbed; but that they might have a free pa≈ø≈øage through it to the <hi>Retina.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Ears and their ≈øeveral Parts.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Auricle. Its Parts. Its u≈øe. The inward Ear. Its Parts. The Dium. Four little Bones. The Hammer. The Anvil. The Stirrop. The orbicular Bone.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Ears</hi> (which according to order we come now to ≈øpeak to) are the in≈øtruments of Hearing, framed by Nature with no le≈øs Art than the Eyes; yea ≈øo full of intricate Meanders they are, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt of ≈øo many Parts, that they will be very hard to be deciphered. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding I will endeavour to give what ≈øatisfaction I can, by what I have learned by In≈øpection, as well as by the Writings of the mo≈øt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Anatomi≈øts.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt then the Parts of the Ear are either <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Inward.</hi> The <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> part is called <hi>Auricula,</hi> which is onely an adjuvant or a≈ø≈øi≈øting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument of Hearing, collecting in its hollowne≈øs ≈øome part of the Air that is the vehicle of the ≈øound, as it is pa≈ø≈øing by.</p>
                        <p>The Parts whereof the outward Ear is framed, are either <hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>common.</hi> The <hi>common</hi> are the Scarf skin, the true Skin, and <hi>membrana nervea,</hi> or nervous Membrane. The <hi>proper</hi> are the Mu≈øcles, Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and the Gri≈øtle. Of the <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> we ≈øhall ≈øpeak in their proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> in the next Book that treats of the Mu≈øcles. The <hi>Veins</hi> of the Ear are branched to it from the external Jugular Vein; the <hi>Arteries</hi> from the Carotid Arteries; and the Nerves from the ≈øecond pair of the Neck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined with the harder Proce≈øs of the ≈øeventh pair. As to the <hi>Gri≈øtle</hi> of which for the greate≈øt part it con≈øi≈øts, that is a ≈øub≈øtance that is fitte≈øt for this place; for if it had been bony, the Ear would both have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57416:104"/>and ≈øo could not have turned it ≈øelf toward the ≈øound, as we ≈øee the Hor≈øe can now move it; and al≈øo it would have been in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual danger of being broken off: and if it had been fle≈øhy or membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous onely, the Hor≈øe's Ears would have flap'd down like Hounds Ears, which would have been a great deformity.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of this outward Ear are, fir≈øt, to ≈øerve for an ornament to the Head; ≈øecondly to receive, or at lea≈øt to help to receive the ≈øounds; for fir≈øt, it gathereth them being di≈øper≈øed in the Air; ≈øecondly, it doth moderate the fiercene≈øs of their motion, ≈øo that they come gently to the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> or Drum, and beat moderately again≈øt it.</p>
                        <p>The internal or inward Ear hath al≈øo ≈øundry Parts, contained <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Os petro≈øum,</hi> as the outward Ear is fa≈øten'd <hi>upon</hi> it.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Parts are fir≈øt the Drum with its Cord and Mu≈øcles; ≈øecondly, four little Bones; thirdly, its Cavities with the implanted Air; and la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, its Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Drum,</hi> called <hi>Tympanum,</hi> is a nervous, round and tran≈øparent Membrane, of mo≈øt exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe, ari≈øing from the ≈øofter proce≈øs of the Auditory Nerve expanded. It is exceeding dry, that it might give the better Echo to the ≈øound. It is al≈øo ≈øtrong, that it ≈øhould the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure outward harms or injuries. It hath a <hi>Cord</hi> behind it for ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ≈øtretching of it, even as the Military Drum hath. As for its <hi>Mu≈øcles,</hi> we ≈øhall de≈øcribe them in the next Book.</p>
                        <p>Within the Membrane of this <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum there is an internal Cavity, called <hi>Concha,</hi> in which are ≈øeveral little dry Bones, which have in them no Marrow, nor are covered with any Membrane or <hi>perio≈øteum:</hi> yet at their ends where they are joined together, they are bound with a ≈ømall Ligament, proceeding from the before mentioned Cord of the Drum.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe little Bones are four in number; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leolus,</hi> that is, a little Hammer. This Hammer hath a round head, which by a loo≈øe Ligament is jointed into the Cavity of the ≈øecond little Bone that is called the Anvil; which head is continued into a ≈ømall neck, that reacheth beyond the middle of the Drum and adhereth to it. About its middle it hath two Proce≈ø≈øes, the one of which, being ≈øhorter, hath the tendon of the internal Mu≈øcle in≈øerted into it; and the other, being longer, hath the tendon of the external, the Drum intervening.</p>
                        <p>The next of the≈øe little Bones is by Anatomi≈øts called <hi>Incus,</hi> the <hi>Anvil,</hi> having one head and two feet, being therefore more like to one of the grinding Double-teeth than to an Anvil.</p>
                        <p>The head of this is indifferent thick, having in the top of it a little ≈ømooth hollowne≈øs, which receives the knob or head of the Hammer. The ≈ømaller foot of the Anvil is tied to the top of the Stirrop by a loo≈øe but firm Ligament, but the thicker foot re≈øteth upon the <hi>Os ≈øquamo≈øum,</hi> or ≈øcaly Bone.</p>
                        <p>The third is called the <hi>Stirrop,</hi> having a perforation in the middle, and is fixed before or rather round that pa≈ø≈øage that is called the oval Window, by which ≈øounds pa≈øs out of the fir≈øt Cavity into the ≈øecond called the Labyrinth. Which Cavities are wrought by Nature in the Rocky-bone, and contain in them the inbred Air. Now as the cry≈øtalline Humour of the Eye is the chief in≈øtrument of the Sight, in re≈øpect of the reception of vi≈øible Images or Forms; ≈øo is this inbred Air of the Ear, the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument which receiveth the forms of Sounds, although there be another more noble Organ which judgeth of them, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewn by and by.</p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57416:105"/>
                        <p>The figure of this Bone is in Hor≈øes triangular, very like the Greek Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Œî, (but in Men it is repre≈øented to be of ≈øomewhat another ≈øhape) which Letter is like ≈øuch a Stirrop as we often ≈øee in old Hangings (not ≈øuch Stirrops as are u≈øed now-a-daies) from its ≈øimilitude unto which I ≈øuppo≈øe it hath its name.</p>
                        <p>The upper part of this Stirrop is ≈ømall, as you may ≈øee by the figure of it, upon which the longe≈øt foot of the Anvil ≈øtands.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and la≈øt of the≈øe little Bones of the Ear was not long ≈øince found out by a diligent Anatomi≈øt, named <hi>Franc. Sylvius,</hi> till who≈øe time there were but three Bones of the Ear reckoned.</p>
                        <p>This Bone from its round ≈øhape is called <hi>orbiculare.</hi> It is tied by a ≈ølen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ligament to the ≈øide of the Stirrop, in that part where the Stirrop is fa≈øtned to the Anvil.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe four Bones is not, that by hitting one again≈øt another they ≈øhould produce a ≈øound, but fir≈øt, to defend the Membrane of the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum, le≈øt it ≈øhould be torn and beat inwards by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ≈øhaking of the outward Air again≈øt it, in loud ≈øounds, ≈øuch as Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the noi≈øe of great Guns and the like.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They are a≈ø≈øi≈øting to the Sen≈øe of Hearing on this manner: The external Air beats again≈øt the Drum, which is driven again≈øt the Hammer, and this ≈øtrikes upon the Anvil, as the Anvil bears again≈øt the Stirrop; which as it does, more ≈øtrongly or weakly, ≈øo does the Stirrop open the oval Window more or le≈øs, and proportionably the ≈øound ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the common Sen≈øory, louder, or lower.</p>
                        <p>We come in the next place to ≈øpeak of the Caverns or <hi>Cavities,</hi> by ≈øome called Dens, which are formed in the mid≈øt of the <hi>Os petro≈øum</hi> or Rockey-bone where it bunches out mo≈øt, and are three in number.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of them is to be ≈øeen as ≈øoon as the Membrane of the Drum is taken away, and is called <hi>Concha,</hi> from its re≈øemblance to the ≈øhell of a Taber. Others call it the Ba≈øin, and ≈øome the Den. It has its fir≈øt deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, (which is that which it is mo≈øt commonly known by) not ≈øo much from its ≈øhape, as from its u≈øe; for when the Membrane is ≈øtruck upon by any outward ≈øound, the Echo is made in this Cavity, even as it is in the hollow of a Taber, or in our common Drum when the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is beat upon; for in all the≈øe the ≈øound is principally occa≈øion'd by the Air included in the Cavity.</p>
                        <p>Nature hath placed in this Cavity divers In≈øtruments; as fir≈øt, ≈øome ≈øerving for pul≈øation, ≈øuch are the four Bones, the Cord and the Mu≈øcles, (of all which before.) Secondly, others for conduction into the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; ≈øuch are two <hi>perforations</hi> or little holes, commonly called Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. And la≈øtly, a third ≈øort for Expurgation; ≈øuch are the pa≈ø≈øages which lead, one into the Palate, and another into the No≈øtrils, by the help of which the pituitous Matter which is collected in this Cavity is di≈øcharged.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt of the <hi>perforations</hi> being the upper and larger, has added to it the Epithet <hi>Oval,</hi> alluding to its figure. This opens inwards or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and that with a pretty wide mouth, into the Labyrinth; but is kept ≈øhut next the <hi>Concha</hi> by the ba≈øis of the Stirrop, when ≈øound cea≈øes. The other being the le≈øs and lower, is of a round ≈øhape (and therefore ≈øtyled <hi>Rotunda.</hi>) This is always open having no covering, and is divided by the <hi>Os ≈øquamo≈øum</hi> into two Pipes, one of which tends to the <hi>Cochlea,</hi> the other into the Labyrinth.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57416:106"/>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the≈øe Cavities of the inward Ear is (from its windings and turnings) called <hi>Labyrinthus,</hi> the Labyrinth. If one con≈øider it in its whole dimen≈øion it is round, and much le≈øs than the former. Its windings are circular, yet the circles run not quite round the Cavity, but come as much ≈øhort of an intire circle as the Gri≈øtles of the Wind-pipe in the Throat do, or rather more, ≈øo that they are commonly termed ≈øemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular. Their u≈øe is to modulate the ≈øounds ≈øo as they may be lei≈øurely communicated to the Auditory Nerve which is di≈øper≈øed through the Membrane that inve≈øts this Cavity, or rather makes it. It has three pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wide holes, two opening <hi>into</hi> it, and one <hi>out of</hi> it. The two that open <hi>into</hi> it, are the oval and round holes, mentioned in the foregoing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. By the≈øe the internal agitated Air pa≈ø≈øes out of the <hi>Concha</hi> into the Labyrinth. That which opens <hi>out of</hi> it is that which pa≈ø≈øes towards the third Cavity called <hi>Cochlea,</hi> into which the afore≈øaid Air pa≈ø≈øes further by it out of the Labyrinth. Be≈øides the≈øe there are four other very ≈ømall holes for the ingre≈øs of the nervous Fibres that are in≈øerted into the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane that cloaths this Cavity.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>third</hi> and la≈øt inner Cavity is called <hi>Cochlea</hi> or the Snail-≈øhell, from the re≈øemblance it hath with that Shell, e≈øpecially in its Spiral winding; which, if you take off the upper part of the Bone, will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>
                        <p>This Cavity is far le≈øs than the former two, being indifferent long but crooked. Into this endeth one Pipe from the round hole of the fir≈øt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and another from the ≈øecond, ju≈øt now mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It is inve≈øted, as the other Cavities are, with a ≈øoft and thin Membrane (after the ≈øame manner as the ≈øockets of the Teeth are) into which (as into that of the Labyrinth) the ≈ølender Fibres of the Auditory Nerve do enter, and that through three or four ≈øeveral holes which are all very ≈ømall.</p>
                        <p>It is filled with the internal inbred Air as well as the former, by which the Echo is made to the impul≈øe of the external Air upon the <hi>Tympanum</hi> that is the vehicle of the ≈øound: And the Auditory Nerve being in≈øerted into the Membrane that cloaths the Cavities, is affected therewith, whereby it comes to be communicated to the original of the Nerves where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sen≈øory is ≈øeated, that judgeth and di≈øtingui≈øheth of them.</p>
                        <p>Into the≈øe three Cavities that make up the Internal Ear, are the ≈øame Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels di≈øtributed as to the External: The Nerves are al≈øo from the ≈øame conjugation, namely the ≈øeventh pair; onely whereas the harder Proce≈øs of the Nerve goes to the External Ear, it is the ≈øofter that comes to the Internal.</p>

                        <p>HAVING de≈øcribed all the Organs of <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> we come in the next place to the third outward Sen≈øe which is the <hi>Smelling,</hi> of which the No≈øe being the In≈øtrument, we are now to enter upon its de≈øcription.</p>
                        <p>As therefore the Ear is divided into an External or outward, and an Internal or inward part; ≈øo will we divide the No≈øe, it being made of the like parts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>External</hi> Parts are the Skin, the Mu≈øcles and Gri≈øtles, Ve≈ø≈øels of all ≈øorts, as al≈øo many Bones, and tho≈øe di≈øtingui≈øhed or divided by ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sutures.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> wherewith the No≈øe is covered is thin, and without any fat under it, for beauty ≈øake; for if there had been any fat naturally in this place, it might have been collected to that quantity or bulk, as to have become a great deformity to the Creature: for which rea≈øon Nature hath ≈øo ordered it, that in this place the Skin ≈øticketh ≈øo fa≈øt to the Mu≈øcles and Gri≈øtles, that it is not ea≈øie to part it from them without renting.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bones</hi> which make the Cavities of the No≈øe are ≈øome proper, and ≈øome common: of which hereafter in the Fifth Book <hi>of the Bones.</hi> The <hi>Gri≈øtles</hi> are five in number, of which we ≈øhall al≈øo di≈øcour≈øe in the ≈øame Book.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of the No≈øe are, <hi>Veins</hi> from the Jugular Veins, and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> from the <hi>Carotides;</hi> al≈øo <hi>Nerves</hi> from the third pair of the Brain, which ≈øend to each ≈øide of the No≈øe one branch, (be≈øides the olfactory Nerves or fir≈øt pair, called the Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes.)</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Internal</hi> Parts of the No≈øe, we ≈øhall begin fir≈øt with the <hi>Coat</hi> or Skin which compa≈ø≈øeth the whole capacity of the No≈øtrils. This Coat is ≈øaid to ari≈øe from that Skin of the Brain which is called the <hi>dura mater;</hi> and is not peculiar to this Part alone, but is as well common to the Mouth, Palate, Tongue, Larynx, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to the No≈øtrils; onely in the No≈øtrils it is thinner and of exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe; for any thing blown up the No≈øe that is of a biting nature, ≈øo irritates it, as immediately to cau≈øe the Hor≈øe to ≈øneeze. This Skin hath on its back-≈øide abundance of little Glands or Kernels, in which the Rheum is ≈øeparated that runs out by the No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>There is al≈øo another Skin belonging to the in≈øide of the No≈øe called the <hi>mu≈øcular Membrane,</hi> which is ≈øaid to draw together or contract the No≈øtrils.</p>
                        <p>In the upper part of the No≈øtrils there is a red <hi>fle≈øhy ≈øpongious ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance,</hi> with which the ≈øpongy Bones are filled up.</p>
                        <p>There are al≈øo ≈øeated at the upper end of the No≈øe next to the Brain over both No≈øtrils a Bone which from its likene≈øs to a Sieve, (by rea≈øon of the innumerable little perforations or holes that are in it) is called <hi>Os cribriforme</hi> or Sieve<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>like Bone. In the in≈øide of this Bone are ≈øeared tho≈øe two productions of the Brain called <hi>prece≈ø≈øus mammillares,</hi> which are the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57416:108"/>true In≈øtruments of Smelling, and are therefore better called the Smelling-nerves. There pa≈øs from them through the holes of this Sieve-like Bone many little Strings or Fibres, which are di≈øper≈øed into all the inward ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the No≈øe, ≈øerving there to be the immediate Organs of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but the Scents are communicated to the common Sen≈øory of the Brain by the afore≈øaid Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes.</p>
                        <p>The principal <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the No≈øe is for Smelling, which is performed in this manner. The No≈øtrils are adjuvant In≈øtruments of Smelling even as the External Ear is of Hearing. For as the Ear gathereth the ≈øounds that fly in the Air; ≈øo when ≈ømells exhale out of odoriferous Bodies into the Air, the Hor≈øe by taking in his breath at his No≈øe, (which he for the mo≈øt part does, and not in at his Mouth as we often do) the ≈øcents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Air a≈øcend up the No≈øtrils to the top of their Cavity, and ≈øo to the before-named Sieve-like Bone, where affecting the little Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Olfactory Nerves that come, as hath been ≈øaid, from the Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes through tho≈øe little holes, tho≈øe Fibres communicate their ≈øen≈øation to the Proce≈ø≈øes, and the≈øe convey it to the original of the Nerves or common Sen≈øory, by which it is di≈øtingui≈øhed.</p>
                        <p>Inferiour u≈øes of the No≈øe are, fir≈øt, to take in the breath by; and next, to ≈øerve as a common Shore or Sink for the di≈øcharge and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ≈øuperfluous flegmatick Humours of the Bloud.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we come to treat of the <hi>Lips</hi> (or the external Parts of the Mouth) which are two in number, one upper and the other lower. The≈øe are framed of a ≈øoft fle≈øhy fungous ≈øub≈øtance, as al≈øo of ≈øome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Mu≈øcles covered with the hairy Skin on the out≈øide of them, but on the in≈øide they are covered with a Membrane common to the Mouth and Stomach.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the Lips are fir≈øt to gather the Hay or Oats or other Food into the Mouth; ≈øecondly to retain, or help to retain it, while it is chewing; thirdly, they ≈øerve to keep the Gums and Teeth from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Injuries.</p>
                        <p>Within the Lips is the <hi>Mouth,</hi> who≈øe Parts are either <hi>containing</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> that is, either tho≈øe that make the Mouth, or ≈øuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>
                        <p>The Parts whereof the Mouth is made, are of two ≈øorts, ≈øome fle≈øhy, others bony. The <hi>fle≈øhy</hi> Parts are the Lips, of which we have already ≈øpoken; al≈øo the Mu≈øcles of the Cheeks and lower Jaw. The <hi>bony</hi> are the upper and nether Jaws, with the Teeth fixed in them.</p>
                        <p>All the≈øe Parts (as al≈øo the whole inward capacity of the Mouth) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Teeth, are lined with a thick Membrane or Skin, which in the Palate is rugged and knotty as it were, by rea≈øon of the many little Glands on the back-≈øide of it, by which part of the Slaver is ≈øeparated into the Mouth; and this Membrane reduplicated maketh the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula,</hi> as ≈øome think; though others more probably hold, that it is of a peculiar ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                        <p>The Parts <hi>contained</hi> within the Mouth are divers. As fir≈øt the Teeth and the Bone <hi>Hyoides</hi> at the root of the Tongue; of both which we ≈øhall treat in the Book of the Bones.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe there are the Gums, the Palate, the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, the Tongue, and the Mu≈øcles that ≈øerve to move it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gums</hi> being in number two, are made up of a hard fle≈øhy ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, de≈øtitute of motion, that ≈øo the Teeth might be better fa≈øtned in their Sockets.</p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57416:108"/>
                        <p>The <hi>Palate</hi> is the upper part of the Mouth, and is called by that name, from its being as it were fenced or <hi>paled</hi> in with Teeth. It extends from the back-part of the Mouth to the Fore-teeth, but is not ≈øo much hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Hor≈øe as in Humane Skulls. It hath in it ≈øome eighteen ≈øteps or bars which reach from the in≈øide of the Fore-teeth to the very farther end of the Mouth. It con≈øi≈øts of Bones, of a peculiar glandulous Fle≈øh, and a thick Coat; which Coat is full of little perforations or holes for the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that is ≈øeparated in the little Glands (above-mentioned) to di≈øtill through into the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> is a red, fungous and longi≈øh kind of a Kernel ≈øeated in the inward or backer-part of the Palate, where the No≈øtrils open into the Mouth, hanging directly downward with a ≈ømall but blunti≈øh end ju≈øt over the chink of the <hi>Larynx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> is ≈øaid to be, fir≈øt, to moderate the coldne≈øs of the Air drawn in by the Lungs. This is <hi>Bartholin</hi>'s opinion, who ≈øays further, that from this u≈øe of it it comes to pa≈øs, that ≈øuch Per≈øons as want it, die Phthi≈øical. Whether that be ≈øo or no I cannot tell: but the main u≈øe of it in an Hor≈øe I take to be, ≈øecondly, to hinder the Water, when he drinks, from pa≈ø≈øing out of his Mouth into his No≈øtrils.</p>
                        <p>This Kernel is very nece≈ø≈øary to be known by all profe≈ø≈øed Farriers, for ≈øuch knowledge might have contributed to the pre≈øervation of many Hor≈øes which for want of it have been lo≈øt. Such are tho≈øe which by rea≈øon of Humours too much flowing to this Kernel have had it ≈øo much di≈øtended, that it hath hung down into the Throat to that degree, that the Hor≈øe hath not been able to ≈øwallow, there being no pa≈ø≈øage left for the Meat to go down; but when he has chew'd it and endeavours to ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, in≈øtead of its going down the Gullet into his Stomach, it comes out at his No≈øe; whereby it comes to pa≈øs that although the Hor≈øe have never ≈øo good a Stomach, yet for all that he comes to ≈øtarve to death with hunger.</p>
                        <p>This my ≈øelf have been ≈øometimes an Eye-witne≈øs of, and have oftener heard of it by others; but could never ≈øee nor hear of any of them, that had any help for this Di≈øtemper; their endeavours proving ≈øtill un≈øucce≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by their not well under≈øtanding either the Di≈øtemper, or the Part affected.</p>
                        <p>This ≈øwelling of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> in Men is called by Phy≈øicians <hi>Ca≈øus <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae;</hi> and by the Vulgar, the falling down of the Palate of the Mouth. It is a Di≈øtemper that commonly comes upon taking ≈øome great cold; but is very ordinarily cured not by Phy≈øicians onely, but by every old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who knows that by holding Pepper or Ginger or the like again≈øt it, the Rheum is thereby drained out of it, and it contracts it ≈øelf to its due and natural bulk, whereby the Party is ≈øpeedily relieved. How far ≈øuch Medicines might contribute to the cure in Hor≈øes, I ≈øhall forbear in this place to give my opinion, becau≈øe as I have already ≈øaid, I do by God's a≈ø≈øi≈øtance de≈øign to publi≈øh a Book of Cures by it ≈øelf, but was willing in the fir≈øt place to teach my Practitioner the frame and u≈øe of the Parts, and to hint ≈øome of tho≈øe Di≈øea≈øes they are incident to, which we have lea≈øt under≈øtood: and by that time the Ingenious Student is come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand them, I ≈øhall I hope be ready to publi≈øh a new and certainer way of curing them than has hitherto been practi≈øed.</p>
                        <p>Next we come to ≈øpeak of the <hi>Tongue</hi> and its Parts. It is called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>Lingua, √† lingendo,</hi> from Licking. It is in figure long, broad and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57416:109"/>thick, e≈øpecially towards the root. It is covered with two Skins; the <hi>outward,</hi> cloathing onely its upper part, which in an Hor≈øe is almo≈øt as ≈ømooth as in Men, though it is much rougher in Oxen, and the like. This Membrane is very porous.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>inward</hi> Skin covers the whole Tongue, the lower ≈øide as well as the upper, and is thin and ≈øoft, having many Teat-like Protuberances bunching out of it, which are in≈øerted into the pores or holes of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coat.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> of the Tongue there is diver≈øity of opinions; for ≈øome would have it of a glandulous, others a mu≈øculous ≈øub≈øtance; and ≈øome, that it has a peculiar ≈øub≈øtance: to which opinion I mo≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, becau≈øe I do not find in any Part of the Body a ≈øub≈øtance like it.</p>
                        <p>It hath <hi>Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> of all ≈øorts; <hi>Veins</hi> from an inward branch of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jugular; <hi>Arteries</hi> from the Carotid Arteries; and <hi>Nerves</hi> of two kinds, one from the fifth and another from the eighth pair of the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The Tongue hath at its root ≈øeveral <hi>Mu≈øcles,</hi> by which all its motions are performed, of which we will ≈øpeak in the next Book. And be≈øides the Mu≈øcles, there is al≈øo at the root of the Tongue a con≈øiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Fat, with which the Mu≈øcles are interlarded as it were.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the Tongue are, fir≈øt, to ta≈øte the Food that is offered, whereby (as well as by the ≈ømell) the Hor≈øe di≈øtingui≈øheth whether it be good and whol≈øom for him or not; and in the next place it helpeth the chewing of the Meat, by to≈ø≈øing it to and fro, and after it is chewed, it a≈ø≈øi≈øteth in turning it down to the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>There is to be found out by di≈ø≈øection underneath the root of the Tongue a large Kernel, from whence two Pipes, called ≈øalival Ducts, do ≈øpring, one from the fore, and the other from the hinder-part of it: The≈øe two at a ≈ømall di≈øtance from the Gland unite into one, which runs pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈øtreight forward under the Tongue toward the Chin: but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way, as Doctor <hi>Wharton</hi> affirms, there are other pretty remarkable Glands (in an Hor≈øe) that ≈øtand on each ≈øide this Duct, and di≈øcharge them≈øelves into it. When it is come near the Chin at the Bridle of the Tongue, it ends into other ≈ømall Glands, through which it pours into the Mouth part of the Slaver that keeps it continually moi≈øt.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides this Duct there are two others of the ≈øame u≈øe, which do ari≈øe out of the Kernels below the root of the Ear, (called <hi>Parotides</hi>) and run on the out≈øide of the Jaw-bone to the middle of that Mu≈øcle of the Cheek that is called <hi>Buccinator,</hi> where they open into the Cavity of the Mouth, into which they di≈øcharge the before-named Liquor, which in the≈øe and the other Glands of the Mouth is ≈øeparated from the Bloud.</p>
                        <p>Now we mu≈øt under≈øtand, this Slaver (or <hi>Saliva</hi>) is not merely an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour excrementitious, as that is which is ≈øeparated in ≈øeveral Kernels in other Parts of the Body, as particularly in the Guts; for this is of great u≈øe, not onely in that it continually moi≈øtens the Mouth, as al≈øo the Hay and Oats whil≈øt they are in chewing; but being ≈øwallow'd down with the Meats, it doth further the fermentation and concoction of them in the Stomach, whither part of this Juice al≈øo goes with every mor≈øel. It is of the ≈øame nature with that which in Men we call the Spittle, and of the ≈øame u≈øe.</p>
                        <p>And here it may not be ami≈øs to recite a ≈øtory I have read of a Per≈øon that had one of the≈øe external ≈øalival Ducts wounded, becau≈øe I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved (the la≈øt Spring at <hi>Greenwich</hi>) the ≈øame accident happen to an Hor≈øe, with the ≈øame ≈øymptom. The Story is thus: A Noble-man being
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57416:110"/>wounded in the middle of the Cheek with having a Gla≈øs thrown at him; the Wound was quickly <hi>almo≈øt</hi> clo≈øed, but in the middle of it, through a little hole, there lei≈øurely di≈øtilled out of it for a long time a watery and clear Liquor, which for all that ever the Surgeon could doe, hindred the intire clo≈øing up of the Wound for almo≈øt two years. This Liquor did di≈øtill out of the ≈øalival Duct, which was not then found out; but at la≈øt an actual Cautery being applied to the end of the Duct, the Liquor was by that means ≈øtopt, and the Wound pre≈øently healed. The Hor≈øe that I ≈øaw had a clear watery Humour running in like manner out of the ≈øide of his Cheek, but in that quantity, that in a few hours time (e≈øpecially in the time next after his drinking) it would make his Manger all a float. A Farrier had him under cure there, and my opinion being ask'd, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to ≈øear it, but he that had him in hand not knowing the occa≈øion of this flux of Humour, thought rowelling of him would ≈øerve; but what he did to him, I had no opportunity ≈øince to inform my ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>Now ≈øeeing a like ca≈øe to this may happen, that my Practitioner may under≈øtand where to apply his Cautery (or red-hot Iron) for the ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Liquor, I have thought it convenient to annex a Scheme of each of the≈øe ≈øalival Ducts; <hi>that</hi> under the Tongue being found out by Doctor <hi>Wharton,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> ari≈øing from the <hi>Parotides</hi> and running on the out≈øide the Gums, by one <hi>Steno,</hi> a Dane.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Containeth a de≈øcription of the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Fle≈øh, and an Apology for not expre≈ø≈øing the Mu≈øcles ≈øo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Figures as I have done other Parts of the Body.</head>
                        <p>IN the Fir≈øt Book Chap. 6. treating of the Mu≈øcles of the Belly, I affirmed that all the <hi>fle≈øhy</hi> Parts of the Body are <hi>mu≈øcular;</hi> which mu≈øt be under≈øtood not of all <hi>Fle≈øh</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> but onely of Fle≈øh <hi>properly</hi> ≈øo called. For there are four kinds of Fle≈øh: Fir≈øt, that which is properly ≈øo called, ≈øuch as is that of the <hi>Mu≈øcles;</hi> ≈øecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of the Bowels, as of the Liver and Spleen, and the like; thirdly, that of the Glands or Kernels; and fourthly, membranous Fle≈øh, ≈øuch as is that of the Stomach, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Fle≈øh of the <hi>Mu≈øcles</hi> is ≈øoft and ruddy, con≈øi≈øting of Fibres and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated or curdled Bloud, called a <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> For the Bloud in its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation as it pa≈ø≈øeth out of the Arteries into the Veins, is extrava≈øated out of the Arteries into the very fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance, out of which it is not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57416:112"/>≈øo clearly imbibed or drunk up by the Veins, but that ≈øome particles of it adhere to the fle≈øhy Fibres, and fill up their inter≈øtices, that is, the empty ≈øpaces between one and another: which Bloud congealing and fixing there, does, I ≈øay, together with the Fibres con≈øtitute that ≈øub≈øtance which we properly call Fle≈øh.</p>
                        <p>As to the other Parts that ≈øerve to con≈øtitute a Mu≈øcle, as al≈øo of its u≈øe, and the rea≈øon of their ≈øundry denominations, I di≈øcour≈øed ≈øo fully in the above-mentioned ≈øixth Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book, that I ≈øhall not need to add any thing to the ≈øame purpo≈øe here: onely I think my ≈øelf in this place obliged to give the Reader the rea≈øons, why I have not repre≈øented the Mu≈øcles in Figures particularly, as I have done other Parts of the Body, nor dare be ≈øo confident of my exactne≈øs in the de≈øcription of them; for</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt, The Mu≈øcles are ≈øo numerous, that to have expre≈øt them all in Figures would have made this Volume at lea≈øt half as dear again as it is; as may be gue≈øt by the number of Copper-plates (in Folio) that Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> has repre≈øented the Mu≈øcles of an Humane Body upon; for they are near fourty, and the≈øe of an Hor≈øe mu≈øt have required rather more than fewer.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Though ≈øome knowledge of the Mu≈øcles, e≈øpecially the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ones, is nece≈ø≈øary that one may know in Tumours which way to make inci≈øion (that is, lengthways of the Mu≈øcle and not acro≈øs, for fear of rendring it u≈øele≈øs by cutting its nervous Fibres a≈øunder) yet to be ≈øo very exact in the knowledg of all of them, is matter rather of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable curio≈øity than real u≈øefulne≈øs.</p>
                        <p>But thirdly, The chief rea≈øon is (for I will confe≈øs it) that I have not had the opportunity my ≈øelf to rai≈øe and in≈øpect every particular Mu≈øcle, ≈øo that I mu≈øt have delineated ≈øeveral of them by gue≈øs and upon tru≈øt, whereby I ≈øhould both have betrayed my own importune vanity, and have led my Reader 'tis like into ≈øeveral Errours. Neither probably may my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal de≈øcription of them be <hi>truly exact</hi> as to tho≈øe which I have not my ≈øelf viewed: though ≈øeeing in tho≈øe that I <hi>have</hi> in≈øpected, I have found ≈øo great a ≈øimilitude between the Mu≈øcles of an Hor≈øe and tho≈øe of a Man, I hope I ≈øhall not be much wide of the truth, if I pre≈øume of the ≈øame Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or likene≈øs in tho≈øe that I have <hi>not</hi> in≈øpected.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the likene≈øs of a Man's and an Hor≈øe's Mu≈øcles the Reader may be pretty well ≈øatisfied if he compare tho≈øe of an Hor≈øe's Belly (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated with the autop≈øie or ≈øelf-view of the Graver) expre≈øt at the end of the ≈øixth Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book, with tho≈øe of a Man's: or take but a pro≈øpect of the next following Figure which repre≈øents an Hor≈øe, ≈øeveral of who≈øe Mu≈øcles I have pre≈øerved, and after having rai≈øed them, placed them in their ≈øeveral places again, the Hor≈øe ≈øtanding up in a Pre≈øs with them on, ju≈øt in the ≈øame po≈øture as he appears in the Figure.</p>
                        <p>To the≈øe rea≈øons I might add the impo≈ø≈øibility that mo≈øt of my Profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion ≈øhould ever attain to an exact knowledge of them; ≈øo that this Book being principally de≈øigned for their u≈øe, I ≈øhould have been at a great deal of co≈øt and more pains to no great purpo≈øe. Now the difficulty lies in this, That mo≈øt of the names of the Mu≈øcles being originally Greek, and ≈øeveral of them ≈øuch as can no way aptly or intelligibly be rendred into Engli≈øh; and con≈øidering the mean education of mo≈øt Farriers, that few of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand ≈øo much as Latin; I ≈øay con≈øidering the≈øe things, 'tis impo≈ø≈øible to de≈øcribe them to their capacity, and therefore I have contented my
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57416:112"/>≈øelf with a more ≈øuperficial and ≈øuccinct de≈øcription of them. And though for my own part I may without vain-glory pretend to a more liberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than mo≈øt of my Profe≈ø≈øion, ≈øo that the Cramp-names (as we call them) of the Mu≈øcles are no ≈øuch hindrance nor di≈øcouragement to me as they will be I fear to mo≈øt others; yet I hope no curious and ingenious Anatomi≈øt, that knows how much time and pains is nece≈ø≈øary to be ≈øpent upon the exact examination of any one Part, will think me ≈øluggi≈øh and ≈øupine, that I have not in tho≈øe few years that I have applied my ≈øelf to this ≈øtudy, attained as yet to the full knowledge of all the Parts of this Bea≈øt that I anatomize. And as on the one hand I hope I may my ≈øelf attain to greater skill in this Art than I have yet arrived at; ≈øo on the other hand I would not be guilty of the vanity of thinking to monopolize it, but ≈øhall both de≈øire and hope that others will make up what I ≈øhall leave imperfect. But thus much I hope may ≈øerve for mine Apology with all ingenuous Men, I ≈øhall therefore return from whence I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed.</p>
                        <p>A ≈øecond ≈øort of Fle≈øh is that of the <hi>Bowels,</hi> as of the Liver, Spleen and Kidneys, who≈øe ≈øub≈øtance hath been held to be for the greate≈øt part parenchymous, or to con≈øi≈øt of an affu≈øion of Bloud congealed about the Ve≈ø≈øels; though latter Anatomi≈øts do affirm them to be for the greate≈øt part glandulous. And to the≈øe hath u≈øed to be reckoned the Heart; but that is of a ≈øub≈øtance far different from the≈øe, as being truly mu≈øcular, and may therefore more properly be ranked with the Mu≈øcles, though it be of a more hard and compact frame than them al≈øo.</p>
                        <p>A third kind of Fle≈øh is that of the <hi>Glands,</hi> ≈øuch as the <hi>Thymus,</hi> which by ≈øome is called the Sweet-bread, and is ≈øituated near the Collar-bone ju≈øt within the Che≈øt, of which we have already treated in the Second Book. Of this ≈øort of glandulous Fle≈øh likewi≈øe are the <hi>Parotides</hi> or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels below the Ears, al≈øo the Ton≈øils (commonly called the Almonds of the Ears) very many Glands in the Me≈øentery and other Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; to which may be added the <hi>Pancreas</hi> ≈øeated in the Lower Belly, which is commonly known by the name of the Sweet-bread.</p>
                        <p>Now the Glands being ≈øpermatical Parts, their parenchyma or fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance is not ≈øanguineous or bloudy, as that of the two former kinds of Fle≈øh; but ≈øpermatical, compo≈øed out of the very fir≈øt rudiments of the embryo or conception. And though the Glands are many times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed in bulk, as particularly in Humane Bodies affected with the King's-Evil, and in Hor≈øes which upon taking great Colds have the Ton≈øils or Almonds of the Ears, and al≈øo the <hi>Parotides</hi> or Kernels below the Ears, ≈øo ≈øwelled and ≈øore, that the Hor≈øe will not be able to ≈øwallow his Drink, or at lea≈øt not to hold down his Head to take it, but mu≈øt be forced to have it given him in a Pail held up as high as the Manger; yet I ≈øay, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of the≈øe Kernels happens not upon any extraordinary afflux of Bloud flowing to tho≈øe Parts, but by a flegmatick Humour falling upon them, and when the Di≈øtemper is cured they return again to their former ≈ømall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, being according to Nature incapable of that growth that is natural and proper to the Parts called ≈øanguineous. To this ≈øort of Fle≈øh (≈øay ≈øome Authours) may the Brain be reduced.</p>
                        <p>The la≈øt ≈øort of Fle≈øh is that which is called <hi>Membranous,</hi> ≈øuch is that of the middle Coat of the Gullet, Stomach, Guts, Womb and Bladder. For though the inmo≈øt and outermo≈øt Coats be purely nervous or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, yet the middle con≈øi≈øts of two ranks of Fibres and a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57416:113"/>that adheres to them, which is di≈øcoverable particularly in the Guts, when they are ≈øcraped by Men that make ≈øtrings for mu≈øical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments, for then you may perceive a great deal of ≈ølimy ≈øtuff to be ≈øcraped off them, which is this Parenchyma: For that they lo≈øe no part of their membranous or fibrous ≈øub≈øtance is evident, in that their ≈øtrength is rather increa≈øed than dimini≈øhed by ≈øuch ≈øcraping. This Coat not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding it is mu≈øcular, yet its Parenchyma differs in many regards from that of the ≈øanguineous Mu≈øcles, particularly in that it is ≈øpermatical as was ≈øaid before of the Glands.</p>
                        <p>Now the Parts that con≈øi≈øt of the≈øe three latter ≈øorts of Fle≈øh are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed in their proper places; but tho≈øe that con≈øi≈øt of the fir≈øt ≈øort, which as I have ≈øaid, is mo≈øt properly ≈øo called, I intend to treat of in this Book which containeth the Doctrine of the Mu≈øcles.</p>

                        <p>HAving in the ≈øixth Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book ≈øpoken of the ≈øeveral Parts of which a Mu≈øcle is compounded, and al≈øo of the differences and actions of them; as likewi≈øe of what u≈øe they are in general; (to which Chapter I refer the Reader) My propo≈øed method requires that I ≈øhould now come to ≈øpeak to every particular of them, beginning with tho≈øe of the Lower Belly: but having in the before-cited Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book treated particularly of <hi>them,</hi> I will in this place pa≈øs them by, de≈øiring the Reader to con≈øult the ≈øaid Chapter for his ≈øatisfaction; for I love not to be tedious with repetitions.</p>
                        <p>The next Mu≈øcles then that we come to ≈øpeak to according to order, are the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi> which are in number three to each Eye.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe is called <hi>Rectus</hi> or <hi>Aperiens,</hi> from its office, which is to lift up or open the Eye-lid.</p>
                        <p>This is ≈øeated in the upper part of the orbit of the Eye, and ≈øpringeth with a ≈ølender but fle≈øhy beginning from the ≈øame place as the <hi>Elevator</hi> of the Eye doth, (which is at the hole which the Optick Nerve pa≈ø≈øes through into the orbit) and holds the ≈øame cour≈øe with it, being of the ≈øame figure and ≈øub≈øtance, that is, fle≈øhy; till at la≈øt parting from it, with a pretty broad but thin Tendon, it is in≈øerted into the Gri≈øtle at the edge of the upper Eye-lid, where it ≈øerves (as hath been ≈øaid) to open the Eye-lid by lifting it up.</p>
                        <p>The two other Mu≈øcles of the Eye-lid are called <hi>Shutters,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe <hi>≈øemicircular,</hi> becau≈øe each runs the length of one Eye-lid: though there are ≈øome that call them <hi>circular</hi> or <hi>orbicular,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing them to be but one Mu≈øcle which compa≈ø≈øes the Eye-lid round as with a circle. But in Bodies that are very mu≈øculous or fle≈øhy, they have by curious Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øts been plainly di≈øcovered to be two, and that the rather, becau≈øe each receives di≈øtinct Nerves from different places. They lie betwixt the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Membrane and the inner ≈ømooth Skin that lines the Eye-lids.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57416:113"/>
                        <p>That which draweth down or ≈øhutteth the upper Lid is larger, and ari≈øeth from the inner corner of the Eye, from whence it pa≈ø≈øeth acro≈øs, though with a kind of an oblique line, towards the outward corner, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pre≈øently fle≈øhy and broad, ≈øo that it filleth up all the ≈øpace betwixt the Eye-brow and the lowe≈øt edge of the Eye-lid, and ≈øo at la≈øt is in≈øerted into the outward corner of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>The le≈ø≈øer of the≈øe two is that which moveth the lower Lid in order to ≈øhut it. This is rather membranous than fle≈øhy at its origin, (being al≈øo very thin) and takes its ri≈øe at the inner corner of the Eye with a ≈øharp beginning as the former did: whence being carried overthwart, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the middle of the Eye-lid, where it becomes ≈øomething fle≈øhy, and continues its cour≈øe to the outward corner, which it turns about, and a≈øcending a little to the upper Eye-lid, is with an indifferent broad end in≈øerted into it.</p>
                        <p>There is another pair of Mu≈øcles which though not belonging properly to the Eye-lids, yet ≈øeem to contribute ≈øomething to their motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or opening, which therefore may rea≈øonably be de≈øcribed in this place, and tho≈øe are the <hi>mu≈øculi frontales,</hi> or Fore-head Mu≈øcles. The≈øe ari≈øe from the Skull near the coronal Suture, and de≈øcend with ≈øtreight Fibres to the Eye-brows, where they terminate. By the help of the≈øe Mu≈øcles the Skin of the Fore-head to which they clo≈øely ≈øtick is contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or wrinkled, and ≈øo by con≈øequence the upper Eye-lid's a little drawn upward.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Mu≈øcles of the Eye.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Eyes have ≈øeven pair of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Their ri≈øe and in≈øertion. Whence they have their names. Attollens and Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens. Adducens. Abducens. The upper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Mu≈øcle. The lower ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Mu≈øcle. The orbicular Mu≈øcle. The manner of rai≈øing the Mu≈øcles of the Eye.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO the moving of each Eye of an Hor≈øe do belong ≈øeven Mu≈øcles; though in Humane Bodies there are accounted but ≈øix, becau≈øe the circular or ≈øu≈øpending Mu≈øcle is ≈øaid in them to be wanting.</p>
                        <p>Of the≈øe ≈øeven, four are ≈øtreight, two oblique or ≈ølanting, and the other circular or round. The ≈øtreight ≈øerve to move the Eyes upwards and downwards, to the right hand and to the left. The oblique move them obliquely; and the circular or round one keeps the Eye ≈øu≈øpended up in its place.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Mu≈øcles have all their ri≈øe from one and the ≈øame place; they have al≈øo the ≈øame progre≈øs and ≈øtructure, and their termination is alike: for they do all ari≈øe from the Membrane that inve≈øts the Orbit of the Eye near the hole where the Optick Nerve pa≈ø≈øeth from the Brain into the ≈øaid Orbit, touching one another at their beginning; but they immediately ≈øeparate, and in their cour≈øe become ≈øtill more and more bulky and fle≈øhy till their middle, which is round and buncheth out with a kind of a bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but as they grow toward their ends or terminations they degenerate from their fle≈øhy into a thin membranous ≈øub≈øtance, which is in≈øerted into the horney Coat of the Eye, encompa≈ø≈øing it as far as it is white.</p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57416:114"/>
                        <p>The≈øe Mu≈øcles have their ≈øeveral appellations or names from the ≈øeveral motions they perform; as fir≈øt, The fir≈øt of the <hi>≈øtreight</hi> Mu≈øcles, from its office of pulling up the Eye, is called <hi>Attollens:</hi> The ≈øecond is called <hi>Deprimens,</hi> becau≈øe it is an Antagoni≈øt to the former, for as that pulls the Eye up, ≈øo this by a contrary motion pulls it down again. From which offices they have al≈øo in Men other two names given them by Anatomi≈øts: the fir≈øt is called <hi>the proud,</hi> becau≈øe when the Eye is pulled up, a Per≈øon looks high and lofty or proud: and on the contrary when the Eye is pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down by the other Mu≈øcle, he looks with a contrary countenance, ≈øubmi≈ø≈øive and humble, for which rea≈øon this ≈øecond Mu≈øcle is called <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis</hi> or <hi>the humble</hi> Mu≈øcle.</p>
                        <p>The next, being the third ≈øtreight Mu≈øcle, is called <hi>Adducens,</hi> becau≈øe it pulleth the Eye towards the No≈øe. It is otherwi≈øe called <hi>Bibitorius,</hi> becau≈øe it performs that motion of drawing the Eye to the No≈øe when we drink, for then we commonly look into the Pot or Gla≈øs that is before our No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The fourth ≈øtreight Mu≈øcle is called <hi>Abducens</hi> or <hi>Indignatorius,</hi> from its office of drawing the Eye to the outer corner, which turn or a≈øpect of the Eye betokens anger or ≈øcorn.</p>
                        <p>Now the≈øe four Mu≈øcles have the≈øe four ≈øeveral motions, when they work ≈øeverally; but when they all four work together, they have but one action, which is to keep the Eye ≈øteady and fixt, which Phy≈øicians call a tonick motion: but in Bea≈øts that have the ≈øu≈øpending Mu≈øcle, the tonick motion is performed mainly, if not altogether, by that Mu≈øcle. You have the≈øe four, as al≈øo the three other lively repre≈øented to you in the twenty fifth Table of the Third Book, <hi>p.</hi> 123.</p>
                        <p>The next are the <hi>oblique</hi> Mu≈øcles, being as hath been ≈øaid, in number two pair, which from their rolling the Eye about are called <hi>circumagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of them is called <hi>obliquus major vel ≈øuperior</hi> (or the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt and large≈øt oblique Mu≈øcle) being longer than the other, but rather ≈ølenderer. It ≈øpringeth from the upper but inner part of the Orbit of the Eye by the hole where the Optick Nerve comes through, (as do all the re≈øt.) From hence it pa≈ø≈øeth ≈øtreight to the upper part of the inner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Eye, where it endeth in a ≈ømall round Tendon, which pa≈ø≈øeth through a tran≈øver≈øe Cartilage or Gri≈øtle there placed, called <hi>Trochlea</hi> (or the Pully) and thence continueth its cour≈øe ≈ølantingly along the upper part of the Eye, till at la≈øt it is in≈øerted into the outmo≈øt Skin of the Eye between the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles <hi>Attollens</hi> and <hi>Abducens.</hi> This rolleth the Eye towards its inner corner.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond oblique</hi> Mu≈øcle is called <hi>obliquus minor ≈øive inferior,</hi> or the le≈øs and lower oblique Mu≈øcle, being ≈øhorter than the other, though ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thicker. This ≈øpringeth from a chink which is in the lower part of the Orbit of the Eye, beginning with a fle≈øhy head, from whence it a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends with a ≈ølanting cour≈øe towards the outward corner of the Eye, about which it turns, and then ends in a ≈øhort roundi≈øh and nervous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which meets with the Tendon of the other oblique Mu≈øcle, and ≈øeeming to unite with it, is in≈øerted in the ≈øame place. This rolls the Eye towards its outer corner.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øeventh Mu≈øcle is called the <hi>orbicular</hi> or <hi>round;</hi> likewi≈øe <hi>Mu≈øculus ≈øu≈øpen≈øorius,</hi> the ≈øu≈øpen≈øory Mu≈øcle; and la≈øtly, becau≈øe it is onely found in Brutes, it hath the name given it of <hi>≈øeptimus Brutorum,</hi> the Brute's ≈øeventh Mu≈øcle. It is ≈øhort and fle≈øhy, encompa≈ø≈øing the Optick Nerve,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57416:114"/>and is in≈øerted into the hinder part of the <hi>Cornea.</hi> You have the figure of it in the afore-mentioned twenty fifth Table of the Third Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is removed from one Eye, but in the other it is plainly repre≈øented <hi>in ≈øitu.</hi> The u≈øe of this Mu≈øcle, as hath been ≈øaid, is to ≈øu≈øtain the Eye, le≈øt by looking continually down toward the ground, it ≈øhould hang too much outward; and by it al≈øo the tonick motion is performed.</p>
                        <p>Having di≈øcour≈øed of the≈øe ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles and of their ≈øeveral actions and u≈øes, I think it very nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øet down the manner of rai≈øing them, that he that will take the pains to examine them in the Creature it ≈øelf, may the better find them, without violating of them unawares, whereby he will lo≈øe his labour, and mi≈øs of ≈øatisfaction in the inquiry after them.</p>
                        <p>You mu≈øt then, after the taking the Eye and all its appurtenances clear out of the Orbit (if you will make your di≈ø≈øection that way; but if you will take the pains to remove the Bones of the Orbit and not cut the Eye out, it will be much better, for then you are ≈øure to ≈øee the Mu≈øcles in their natural ≈øituation: but whether you remove the Bones, or take the Eye out, you mu≈øt I ≈øay) make your di≈ø≈øection on this manner: Fir≈øt, you mu≈øt with a pair of Sci≈ø≈øers cut off the Fat and the Skins before you rai≈øe any of the Mu≈øcles, making them as clean as you can. Then begin with them in order thus: fir≈øt rai≈øe the larger or upper oblique Mu≈øcle, then the le≈ø≈øer or lower oblique; then the four ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles: but you mu≈øt onely rai≈øe the larger oblique Mu≈øcle and not remove it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you have ≈øeen and removed the other five; for when the others are removed, you will the plainer perceive how the Tendon of the ≈øaid Mu≈øcle pa≈ø≈øeth through the Pully, that is ≈øeated in the inner corner of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>After you have had a full view of the≈øe Mu≈øcles before-named, then mind the la≈øt and ≈øeventh Mu≈øcle, which ≈øtill encompa≈ø≈øeth the Optick Nerve, reaching from the place where the other Mu≈øcles had their ri≈øe, quite down to the hinder hemi≈øphere of the Eye.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The fir≈øt pair of Abducent Mu≈øcles. The ≈øecond pair. The fir≈øt pair of Adducent Mu≈øcles. The ≈øecond pair.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>No≈øe</hi> of an Hor≈øe ≈øo far as it is gri≈øtly, is moved ≈øeveral ways, which motions are performed by the≈øe following Mu≈øcles. Fir≈øt it is drawn together to ≈øhut the No≈øtrils by the <hi>Adducent</hi> or <hi>Claudent</hi> Mu≈øcles: and ≈øecondly it is drawn a≈øunder to open the No≈øtrils by the <hi>Abducent</hi> or <hi>Aperient</hi> Mu≈øcles. And to the performing each motion there belong two pair of Mu≈øcles; ≈øo that in all there are eight Mu≈øcles that belong to the No≈øe. I ≈øhall de≈øcribe the two latter pair fir≈øt, whereof</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt pair ari≈øes from the upper Jaw-bone, near the fir≈øt proper pair of the Lips, and is in≈øerted partly into the lower part of the <hi>Alae,</hi> or gri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumference of the No≈øtrils, and partly into the upper part of the upper Lip.</p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57416:115"/>
                        <p>The other pair begins at the top of the No≈øe near the Eye, with an acute and fle≈øhy beginning, whence de≈øcending ≈øomewhat ≈ølantingly, and in its pa≈ø≈øage lying upon each ≈øide of the No≈øe, it doth at la≈øt end at the <hi>Alae,</hi> as the other pair did, but with a broader and fle≈øhier end. Each of the≈øe Mu≈øcles being narrow at the beginning, and ending broad, is in ≈øhape triangular or three-≈øquare, like the Greek Letter Œî <hi>delta,</hi> from whence it is called by ≈øome <hi>deltoides.</hi> The u≈øe of this pair, as al≈øo of the former, is to draw the gri≈øtly circumference or wings of the No≈øtrils upwards, and ≈øo to widen and open them.</p>
                        <p>The other two pair are called the <hi>Adducent</hi> or clo≈øing Mu≈øcles; the fir≈øt pair of which is <hi>external,</hi> ari≈øing about the root of the Gri≈øtle, and a≈øcending cro≈øs-ways to the ridg or tip of the No≈øe, into which it is in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This pair is more fle≈øhy than the other, though indeed there is not much Fle≈øh in any of the Mu≈øcles of the No≈øe, and therefore it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a very accurate Anatomi≈øt to rai≈øe any of them, and to di≈øtingui≈øh them.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond pair of the clo≈øing Mu≈øcles are <hi>internal,</hi> and are hid in the Cavity of the No≈øtrils under the inner Coat that cloaths them. The≈øe are not ≈øo fle≈øhy as the former. They ari≈øe from the end of the Bone of the No≈øe, and ≈øpreading into a kind of membranous ≈øub≈øtance, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend to the gri≈øtly circumference of the No≈øtrils where they terminate.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt pair of the≈øe Mu≈øcles being contracted depre≈øs the <hi>Alae</hi> or Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles of the No≈øe, and the latter pair draw them inwards, and ≈øo clo≈øe the No≈øtrils; to which motion the orbicular or round Mu≈øcle of the upper Lip is a≈ø≈øi≈øtant, for by its drawing the upper Lip downwards, it doth at the ≈øame time con≈øtringe or ≈øtraiten the No≈øtrils.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The fir≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mu≈øcle, called the four≈øquare Mu≈øcle. The ≈øecond common Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, called the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter.

The fifth pair, called Obliqu√® de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahens. The odd Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, called Orbicularis.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO the <hi>Lips</hi> do belong ≈øeveral pair of Mu≈øcles, ≈øome of which are <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Lips</hi> alone, and others are <hi>common</hi> both to the <hi>Cheeks</hi> and <hi>Lips.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>common</hi> are on each ≈øide of the Face two. The fir≈øt of which is called <hi>detrahens quadratus,</hi> or the four-≈øquare drawers a≈øide of the Cheeks and Lips. This ≈øhews more like a Skin than a Mu≈øcle, being broad and thin, onely it is interlaced with fle≈øhy Fibres, which makes it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Mu≈øcle.</p>
                        <p>It ari≈øes from one of the Vertebres of the Neck on its out≈øide, as al≈øo from the Shoulder-blade, the Collar-bone and Brea≈øt-bone, from whence it a≈øcends with oblique or ≈ølanting Fibres up to the Chin, Lips, and root of the No≈øe; which Parts it draws downwards with a ≈ølanting motion.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond <hi>common</hi> Mu≈øcle of the Cheeks and Lips, is called in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies <hi>Buccinator</hi> the Trumpeter, becau≈øe in blowing a Trumpet the main ≈øtre≈øs lies upon this Mu≈øcle; though others derive that name from <hi>Bucca</hi> the Cheek, becau≈øe it is the mo≈øt con≈øiderable Mu≈øcle of it,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57416:115"/>and on this account it may retain the ≈øame name in an Hor≈øe: or it may be called the <hi>Contracter,</hi> from its action, which is to contract the Cheek.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øprings from almo≈øt the whole length of the <hi>upper</hi> Jaw-bone, and is in≈øerted into the whole length of the <hi>lower,</hi> at the root of the Gums. It is thin and membranous, and interlaced with divers Fibres running ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ways; and hath the inner Coat of the Mouth ≈øo clo≈øely and firmly adhering to it, that it is ≈øcarce ≈øeparable from it. This Mu≈øcle is ≈øeated under the upper part of the former, and is ≈øpread over the whole dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Cheek.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> in Hor≈øes and other Brutes is to be as a Hand to help the Mouth in its chewing motion; for as the Meat in chewing falls on the out≈øide of the Teeth, betwixt them and the Cheek, this Mu≈øcle helps to turn it over the Teeth again, that it may be ≈øufficiently broken and ground, and made thereby the readier for concoction when it is turned down to the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides this office of a≈ø≈øi≈øting in chewing, it doth ≈øerve al≈øo at other times upon any occa≈øion to move the Cheeks and Lips.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the Mu≈øcles that are <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Lips</hi> onely, and tho≈øe are by Anatomi≈øts accounted five pair and one odd one. The fir≈øt of them is called <hi>par Attollens,</hi> or Lifters up of the Lip. This pair ≈øpring from the upper Jaw, where it makes the hollow of the Cheek. At their ri≈øe they are broad and fle≈øhy, from thence pa≈ø≈øing down obliquely along the Cheeks, each of them is in≈øerted into its own ≈øide of the upper Lip, near the No≈øe. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles, if they both of them act toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to draw the upper Lip directly upwards and outwards; but if onely one acts, then is but one ≈øide of the Lip drawn upward oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You may plainly ≈øee the≈øe Mu≈øcles work, if you take notice of a Ston'd Hor≈øe after he hath ≈ømelt to a Mare; for then he will mo≈øt times hold up his Head in the Air, and turn up his upper Lip till he hath almo≈øt turned it in≈øide outwards. And the like you may ≈øee many Hor≈øes doe, if you onely let them ≈ømell to another Hor≈øe's Dung.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair is called <hi>Abducens,</hi> the Drawers of the Lip on one ≈øide. This ari≈øes at the Cavity that is under the <hi>Os jugale</hi> with a fle≈øhy and round beginning, which is cover'd with ≈øome Fat, e≈øpecially in fat Hor≈øes; from whence they run down on each ≈øide to the middle of the upper Lip, into which they are in≈øerted with a ≈øtrong round Tendon. The≈øe jointly move the Lips upwards and outwards as the former did, a≈ø≈øi≈øting them in their motion; and when either of them acts ≈øingly, then it a≈ø≈øi≈øts the action of one of the former that is on its own ≈øide, and helps to draw the Lip upwards of one ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called by <hi>Riolanus, Zugomaticum</hi> or <hi>Jugale,</hi> from its ri≈øe, which is outwardly from the proce≈øs of the <hi>Os jugale.</hi> At their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they are fle≈øhy and ≈øomewhat round, and running downward a little overthwart the Cheeks they reach at la≈øt to the ≈øides of the upper Lip, where they are in≈øerted near the corner of the Mouth. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to draw the Lip upwards ≈øideways.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> pair is called <hi>Deprimens,</hi> or the Drawers down of the lower Lip. The≈øe ari≈øe fle≈øhy and broad from the lowermo≈øt and outwardmo≈øt part of the Lower Mandible; from whence each marches obliquely to the under Lip, into which they are in≈øerted about the middle of it. The u≈øe of this pair is to draw the under Lip downwards and ≈øomewhat out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57416:116"/>So that it joineth in the ≈øame action with the fir≈øt pair of the common Mu≈øcles called <hi>Detrahens quadratus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> pair is called <hi>Obliqu√® detrahens,</hi> from their office, which is to draw the lower Lip obliquely downwards and outwards. They take their beginning from the ≈øides of the lower Jaw, where they ri≈øe with a fle≈øhy and broad head; from whence they a≈øcend upwards, growing in their pa≈ø≈øage ≈øomething narrower, and are each in≈øerted into the corners of the lower Lip. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is, as hath been ≈øaid, to draw the lower Lip obliquely downwards and outwards.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we come to the odd Mu≈øcle, called <hi>Orbicularis,</hi> or orbicular, becau≈øe it goes round the circuit of both the Lips. It is al≈øo called <hi>Con≈øtringens,</hi> becau≈øe it ≈øerves as it were for a Sphincter Mu≈øcle to pur≈øe up or contract the Lips. Be≈øides the≈øe names it has in Men that of <hi>O≈øculatorius,</hi> the Ki≈ø≈øing Mu≈øcle, becau≈øe it contracts or draws the Lips together in ki≈ø≈øing. It ≈øticks very clo≈øe to the Skin of the Lips, and makes up the greate≈øt part of their ≈øub≈øtance.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>upper Jaw</hi> being immoveable hath no Mu≈øcles, there being no occa≈øion for them where there is no motion, which is their onely u≈øe. But the <hi>lower Jaw</hi> which hath motions of divers ≈øorts, doth require divers ≈øorts of Mu≈øcles to perform them. Now the≈øe Mu≈øcles are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber five pair.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is called the <hi>Temporal,</hi> becau≈øe they are ≈øeated upon the Temples. They ≈øpring on each ≈øide from the Bones of the Brow or Fore-head, the <hi>Synciput,</hi> Temples and Wedge-like Bone. They are the ≈øtronge≈øt and large≈øt of all the five pair. Their beginning is fle≈øhy, large and ≈øemicircular, their in≈øide lying upon the <hi>Perio≈øteum,</hi> and their out≈øide covered with the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> They de≈øcend under the <hi>Os jugale</hi> to the acute Proce≈øs of the lower Jaw, into which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted by a ≈øhort but very ≈øtrong Tendon. The≈øe Mu≈øcles with great force pull up the lower Jaw, and ≈øo ≈øhut the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair hath the name of <hi>Deprimens,</hi> becau≈øe they pull down the Jaw. They are al≈øo from their ≈øhape, having as it were two bellies, called <hi>biventre.</hi> The≈øe being a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the <hi>quadrati,</hi> which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed in the foregoing Chapter (being one of the pairs that are common to the Cheeks and Lips) pull down the Jaw, and ≈øo open the Mouth. They ari≈øe with a broad and nervous beginning from the Proce≈øs of the Temple-bone called <hi>Styloides,</hi> and ≈øuddenly becoming round, fle≈øhy and ≈ømall, they pa≈øs downwards, and in their middle where they come to the flexure of the lower Jaw-bone, they lo≈øe their fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a nervous and round Tendon, and then becoming fle≈øhy again they are in≈øerted into the inner ≈øide of the lower Jaw at the middle or fore-part of it.</p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57416:116"/>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Ma≈ø≈øeteres,</hi> becau≈øe they are very a≈ø≈øi≈øtant in the office of <hi>chewing,</hi> by moving the Jaw to the right and left ≈øide. Each hath two beginnings: the fir≈øt is large, ≈øtrong and nervous, ari≈øing from that Suture where the fourth and fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw are joined; the other beginning is fle≈øhy, ≈øpringing from the <hi>Os jugale.</hi> They are firmly and largely in≈øerted into the out≈øide of the lower Jaw. The≈øe Mu≈øcles, by rea≈øon of their diver≈øity of Fibres, move the nether Jaw both forwards, backwards and to the ≈øides, and ≈øo in a manner cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> pair are called <hi>Pterygoideum externum,</hi> as if they re≈øembled a pair of <hi>Wings.</hi> The≈øe like the former have al≈øo a double beginning, partly nervous, and partly fle≈øhy. They ≈øpring partly from the upper and outward ≈øide of the Wing-like Proce≈øs of the Wedge-like Bone, and partly from the rough and ≈øharp line of the ≈øame Bone, from whence they march down with ≈øtreight Fibres, becoming in their cour≈øe larger and thicker, till they come to the lateral part of the lower Jaw, into who≈øe in≈øide they are in≈øerted with a ≈øtrong Tendon. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair of Mu≈øcles is to open the Jaw and move it forward, which appeareth when the Teeth of the lower Jaw are ≈øtretched farther out than tho≈øe of the upper.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> and la≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles of the lower Jaw are called <hi>Pterygoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deum internum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe with a nervous beginning from the inner ≈øide or cavity of the Wedge-like Bone, at its wing-like Proce≈øs; then becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fle≈øhy, large and thick, they march down with a ≈øtreight pa≈ø≈øage to the inner and hinder part of the lower Jaw, where they are in≈øerted by a nervous, broad and ≈øtrong Tendon. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is to draw the Jaw towards its head or backwards; and al≈øo to help the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mu≈øcle to draw the Jaw up.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The External Ear hath four Mu≈øcles. 1. The lifter up of the Ear. 2. The puller back of the Ear. 3. Adducens Aurem. 4. Abducens Aurem. 1. The Inward Ear hath two. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. 2. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Ears</hi> in Brutes (e≈øpecially ≈øuch as have large Ears, as Hor≈øes, A≈ø≈øes, Oxen, Hares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) differ much in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude from tho≈øe of Men, in whom they are ≈øo very ≈ømall, that <hi>Galen</hi> calls them, the lineaments of Mu≈øcles. The rea≈øon of which is, that in Man the Ears are mo≈øt commonly immoveable, (though there have been ≈øome that could move them) and therefore to have large Mu≈øcles were needle≈øs; and yet to have none at all, would look like a defect in the mo≈øt perfect of all Animals. But though Man cannot move his Ears, yet is that no prejudice to his hearing; for the want of that motion is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by the ea≈øie and ≈øpeedy motions of his Head, whereby he can turn it on every ≈øide to receive the ≈øounds; whereas four-footed Bea≈øts, that have the motions of their Heads not ≈øo nimble, have need to have their Ears always moveable every way, to receive the ≈øounds from every ≈øide: and their moveablene≈øs has al≈øo a further u≈øe, to wit, to drive away
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57416:117"/>Flies and other In≈øects that are trouble≈øome to the Bea≈øt, which Men can doe with their Hands.</p>
                        <p>The Ear we divided, in the former Book, into the <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> The <hi>Outward</hi> (of which we have been di≈øcour≈øing thus far in this Chapter) has four Mu≈øcles; and the≈øe are tho≈øe which are ≈øo much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Brutes than Men. The <hi>Inward</hi> Ear has two, which are of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable largene≈øs in both.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe we come to treat of is the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the <hi>Outward</hi> Ear, which goes by the name of <hi>Attollens Aurem,</hi> the lifter or puller up of the Ear. This ari≈øes at the out≈øide of the Frontal or Forehead Mu≈øcle, and at its ri≈øe is thin and membranous; from whence being carried over the Temporal Mu≈øcle, and growing in its cour≈øe ≈øomething narrower, it doth at la≈øt in≈øert it ≈øelf into the upper part of the Ear, moving it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Detrahens Aurem,</hi> or the puller back of the Ear. This Mu≈øcle ari≈øes from the Mammillary Proce≈øs with a fle≈øhy, broad and fibrous head; and ≈øo growing narrower in its progre≈øs is at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted into the root of the Gri≈øtle of the Ear, ≈øometimes by two, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by three Tendons. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Mu≈øcle is to draw the Ear back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and ≈øomewhat upwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is called <hi>Adducens Aurem,</hi> by which the Ear is drawn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and ≈øomewhat downwards. This is ≈øaid to be but a part of the <hi>mu≈øculus quadratus</hi> before ≈øpoken of in the fifth Chapter of this Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the common Mu≈øcles of the Cheeks and Lips. This Mu≈øcle a≈øcending with its Fibres is implanted into the lower ≈øide of the root of the Ear.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Abducens Aurem,</hi> becau≈øe it draws or pulls the Ear backwards. This takes its beginning at the <hi>Occiput</hi> or back-part of the Head from the Coat that cloaths tho≈øe Mu≈øcles that belong to that part, where it is at fir≈øt ≈øomething narrow, but afterward waxing broader it is carried tran≈øver≈øly to the hinder part of the Ear, into which it is in≈øerted. This a≈ø≈øi≈øts the ≈øecond in its action, having ≈øometimes two, and ≈øometimes three Tendons as that has.</p>
                        <p>The next are the two Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Inner</hi> Ear (called <hi>Auris,</hi> as the <hi>Outward</hi> Ear is called <hi>Auricula</hi>) the fir≈øt of which is called <hi>Externus Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani Auris,</hi> or the external Mu≈øcle of the Drum of the Ear, becau≈øe it moves the Membrane of the Ear ≈øo called upwards and outwards. This is thin but broad at its ri≈øe, which is from the upper part of the pa≈ø≈øage of the Ear; then becoming narrower it grows into a very fine and ≈ømall Tendon, which is carried on the out≈øide of the <hi>Tympanum</hi> till it arrive at its centre or middle into which it is in≈øerted, where on the in≈øide of this <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum</hi> the little Bone called the Hammer ≈øticketh, which with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane or <hi>Tympanum</hi> this Mu≈øcle draweth a little outward and upward. This Mu≈øcle as al≈øo the next are very ≈ømall, there being ≈øcarce any in the whole Body again ≈øo ≈ømall as they are; and therefore it will require great skill to rai≈øe them without violating of them. To prevent which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker is to open with great care the <hi>Os petro≈øum</hi> which is to be done on that ≈øide which is next to the Temples, taking out the pieces of Bones by degrees that the≈øe Mu≈øcles may receive no prejudice. It is left to the di≈øcretion of the Di≈ø≈øector whether he will remove the Bones with a Chi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, or Saw, or by filing, ≈øo he doe it carefully.</p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:57416:117"/>
                        <p>The ≈øecond is called <hi>Internus,</hi> and hath its origination from the bottom of the <hi>Os cuneiforme</hi> or Wedge-like Bone, there where it is joined with the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus petro≈øus.</hi> It is ≈øeated inwardly in the Cavity of the <hi>Os petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum,</hi> being fle≈øhy at its beginning, yet thin and ≈ømall: at its middle it is divided into two very ≈ømall and very thin Tendons, whereof one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted into the upper Proce≈øs of the <hi>Malleus</hi> or Hammer, and the other into the neck of it. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Mu≈øcle, alone, is to draw the head of the Hammer obliquely forwards, and al≈øo to draw it ≈øomewhat inwards: but when the≈øe two act both together, they move the <hi>Tympanum</hi> with its ≈ømall Bones upwards and downwards, which is done when the Hor≈øe would carefully li≈øten or harken to any approaching noi≈øe.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Tongue hath five pair of proper Mu≈øcles. 2. Hyp≈øilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo≈ø≈øum. 3. Myloglo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum. 4. Cerato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo≈ø≈øum. 5. Styloglo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Tongue</hi> in Brutes hath but two principal u≈øes, <hi>viz.</hi> to ta≈øte the Food, and to rowl it up and down the Mouth: but in Men it has a third u≈øe, which is to be the main in≈øtrument of Speech. Yet notwith≈øtanding there are as many Mu≈øcles that belong to it in Brutes as there do in Men; for in ≈øome regard it has a further u≈øe in them than in Men, ≈øeeing it does not onely ta≈øte and rowl about the Meat, but it ≈øerves al≈øo to gather it into the Mouth; for <hi>that</hi> they doe with their Tongue, becau≈øe they have not the help of Hands as we have. Wherefore that the Tongue might perform all the≈øe offices, it was nece≈ø≈øary it ≈øhould be furni≈øhed with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Mu≈øcles, to make it capable of being moved every way, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, upward and downward, and ≈øideways. And le≈øt in undergoing the≈øe motions it ≈øhould be made to reach farther than is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, Nature hath re≈øtrained it with a ≈øtrong Ligament underneath, which in Men is called the <hi>Fraenum</hi> or Bridle of the Tongue.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> therefore hath five pair of Mu≈øcles <hi>proper</hi> to it ≈øelf, be≈øides tho≈øe that are <hi>common</hi> to it and the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> of which in the following Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair <hi>proper</hi> to it is called <hi>Genioglo≈ø≈øum</hi> (or the Chin-tongue pair) ≈øo called becau≈øe their ri≈øe is from the Chin, and their in≈øertion into the Tongue. This name is proper enough in Men who have Chins, but agrees not ≈øo well with them in Hor≈øes (or other Brutes) in whom we call all that part below the Teeth, <hi>the lower Jaw,</hi> not di≈øtingui≈øhing any part of it by the name of <hi>the Chin.</hi> But notwith≈øtanding I ≈øhall de≈øcribe them by that name, becau≈øe it would be too tedious and too bold an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for me to invent new names for this as well as for others that are in Brutes as improperly called by ≈øuch names as this pair is; leaving ≈øuch an attempt to tho≈øe that have both more lei≈øure, and that make a greater figure in the Anatomical Province.</p>
                        <p>This pair ari≈øe from the ruggedne≈øs which is in the middle of the lower Jaw before, in the inner and lower part of it. In their progre≈øs they are ≈øaid to have ≈øeveral ≈øuch in≈øcriptions as the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57416:118"/>Paunch have, as if each con≈øi≈øted of ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles; however that be, they reach to the middle of the Tongue where they are in≈øerted into its lower ≈øide. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to move the Tongue forwards, towards the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth, and many times out of the Mouth, that is, when the Bea≈øt gathers in his Meat.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair is called <hi>Hyp≈øiloglo≈ø≈øum,</hi> (which word ≈øhould be writ without an H, ≈øeeing they have this name becau≈øe they ri≈øe from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> which is otherwi≈øe called <hi>Yp≈øiloides,</hi>) from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembling in ≈øhape the Greek Letter <hi>v (Yp≈øilon.)</hi> They end in the middle of the Tongue, and have an action contrary to the former; for as tho≈øe mov'd the Tongue outward, ≈øo the≈øe move it ≈øtreight inward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Myloglo≈ø≈øum,</hi> from the places of its ri≈øe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion; for they ari≈øe from the inner part of the lower Jaw, at the roots of the farthe≈øt <hi>grinding Teeth,</hi> and are in≈øerted into the Ligament by which the <hi>Tongue</hi> is tied to the <hi>fauces</hi> or Jaws. If this pair work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they draw the Tongue downwards; but if onely one of them work, then it draws the Tongue obliquely to its own ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> pair is called <hi>Ceratoglo≈ø≈øum,</hi> becau≈øe they ari≈øe from the <hi>horns</hi> of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> and reaching from thence to the ≈øides of the <hi>Tongue</hi> are there in≈øerted into it. If one of the≈øe work alone, it draws the Tongue a≈ølant to either the right or left ≈øide; but if both work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they draw the Tongue downwards and inwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> and la≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles <hi>proper</hi> to the Tongue are called <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loglo≈ø≈øum,</hi> becau≈øe they ari≈øe from the <hi>Styloides</hi> (or Pen-like) Proce≈øs of the Temple-bones, being fle≈øhy at their beginning, though very ≈ømall and ≈øharp; but afterwards becoming broader and thicker, they run to the ≈øides of the Tongue, into which they are in≈øerted about the middle of its length. If either of the≈øe Mu≈øcles move ≈øingly, the Tongue is drawn to the right, or left ≈øide; but if both act together, they pull the Tongue upwards and inwards.</p>

Such are tho≈øe that are common to the Tongue and the Bone called <hi>hyoides</hi> that is fa≈øten'd to its root or ba≈øis, which are in number four pair.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair is called <hi>Sternohyoideum,</hi> becau≈øe they ≈øpring from the upper but inner part of the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Brea≈øt-bone (with a broad and fle≈øhy beginning) and a≈øcending under the Skin of the Neck by the Wind-pipe (≈øtill keeping the ≈øame largene≈øs and ≈øub≈øtance) are at length in≈øerted into the root or bottom of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> which they move downward and backward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair is oppo≈øite to the former, and is called <hi>Geniohyoideum.</hi> The≈øe are large, ≈øhort and fle≈øhy all over, and ari≈øe with Fibres of a divers cour≈øe, from the in≈øide of the fore-part of the lower Jaw (called in Men the <hi>Chin</hi>) and are in≈øerted into the middle part of the Bone <hi>hyoides,</hi> which they draw ≈øtreight upwards and a little forwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Coracohyoideum.</hi> The≈øe are ≈ølender, but ≈øtrong, and long; yea con≈øidering the ≈ølenderne≈øs of them, they are the longe≈øt Mu≈øcles of the whole Body. They ari≈øe out of the Proce≈øs called <hi>Coracoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> at the upper end of the Shoulder-blade near the Neck, and run ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely upward under the fir≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles of the Head called <hi>Ma≈øtoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deum,</hi> where they lo≈øe their fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance, as giving way to the other that are more worthy and con≈øiderable than them≈øelves, and degenerate each into a nervous and round Tendon for ≈øome time; but ≈øo ≈øoon as they are pa≈øt the≈øe Mu≈øcles, they become mu≈øculous again, and ≈øo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue till they reach to the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> into who≈øe horns they are in≈øerted. The≈øe becau≈øe of their two bellies are by ≈øome called Diga≈øtricks. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to pull the <hi>Os hyoides</hi> obliquely downwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and la≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Os hyoides</hi> is called <hi>Styloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratohyoideum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe from the root of the Appendix or Proce≈øs cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Styloides,</hi> and end in the <hi>horns</hi> of <hi>Os hyoides.</hi> They move the Bone obliquely upwards.</p>
                        <p>I hope the Engli≈øh Reader will pardon me for not tran≈ølating the names of the≈øe Mu≈øcles, for it is impo≈ø≈øible for any Man to doe it, ≈øeeing our Engli≈øh Tongue is not capable of ≈øuch compo≈øitions as the Greek admits of, from whence the≈øe names are borrowed: but he will ≈øee the rea≈øons of the names, if he ob≈øerve but the parts from whence the Mu≈øcles are ≈øaid to ri≈øe, and into which they are in≈øerted, in the de≈øcription of them.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Larynx hath two pair of common Mu≈øeles, viz. 1. Sterno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyreoide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 2. Hyothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reoideum. 1 and four pair proper ones and an odd one, viz. Cricothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reoideum. 2. Cricoary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenoideum po≈øticum. 3. Cricoary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenoideum laterale. 4. Thyreoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytaenoide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 5. The Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Arytaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Larynx</hi> in Mankind is the main in≈øtrument in modulating or forming the Voice, ≈øo as to make the tone high or low, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though few Bea≈øts can alter their tones with that variety that a Man can, yet have they the ≈øame number of Mu≈øcles to move the ≈øeveral Gri≈øtles whereof the <hi>Larynx</hi> is compo≈øed. Now its Mu≈øcles are either <hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>common.</hi> The <hi>common</hi> are tho≈øe that are implanted into the <hi>Larynx,</hi> but ari≈øe not therefrom; and the <hi>proper</hi> are tho≈øe that both ari≈øe and end in the <hi>Larynx.</hi> The <hi>common</hi> are four, and the <hi>proper</hi> nine.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the <hi>common</hi> pair is called <hi>Sternothyreoideum,</hi> and by ≈øome <hi>Bronchium,</hi> or the Weazand-mu≈øcles. The≈øe ari≈øe with a fle≈øhy and broad beginning from the upper and inner part of the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Brea≈øt-bone at the very Throat, a≈øcending with right or ≈øtreight Fibres up by the ≈øides of the Wind-pipe, continuing the ≈øame largene≈øs and ≈øub≈øtance till they reach to the <hi>Cartilago thyreoides,</hi> or Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, into which they are in≈øerted. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to draw down the ≈øaid Gri≈øtle, and ≈øo to widen the Chink as ≈øome Authours think; though others are of opinion that ≈øuch drawing of it down, ≈øerves to ≈øtraiten the Chink.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair is called <hi>Hyothyreoideum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe from the lower ≈øide of the Bone <hi>hyoides,</hi> having a broad and fle≈øhy beginning; from whence de≈øcending with ≈øtreight Fibres they are in≈øerted into the <hi>Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go thyreoides;</hi> by lifting which upwards they are ≈øaid to ≈øtraiten the Chink of the <hi>Larynx;</hi> though ≈øome on the contrary affirm that they widen it.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the <hi>proper</hi> Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair of which is called <hi>Cricothyreoideum anticum,</hi> becau≈øe they take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>fore-part</hi> of the Ring-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle called <hi>Cricoides,</hi> and proceed obliquely to the Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle or <hi>Thyreoides,</hi> into who≈øe ≈øides they are implanted. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair of Mu≈øcles is to move the Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle or <hi>Thyreoides</hi> obliquely downwards, and by that means to open the <hi>glottis</hi> or Chink of the <hi>Larynx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the <hi>proper</hi> pairs of Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Larynx</hi> are called <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coarytaenoideum po≈øticum.</hi> The≈øe contrary to the former ari≈øe from the lower and <hi>back-part</hi> of the Ring-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, and running upward with ≈øtreight Fibres are in≈øerted with a nervous end into the lower ≈øide of the <hi>Arytaenoides</hi> or Ewer-like Gri≈øtle, which it pulls upward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and thereby opens and widens the <hi>Larynx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Cricoarytaenoideum laterale,</hi> becau≈øe they are ≈øeated at the <hi>≈øides</hi> of the former pair. They ari≈øe from the ≈øides of the Anulary or Ring-fa≈øhioned Cartilage ≈øomewhat ≈ølender; from whence proceeding directly upwards, and becoming more large and fle≈øhy, they come to the <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> into the ≈øides of which they are implanted in that part that the foregoing pair did not cover. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to open the <hi>Larynx</hi> by drawing the Gri≈øtles obliquely a≈øide.</p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57416:119"/>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> pair is called <hi>Thyreoarytaenoideum.</hi> The≈øe are the large≈øt and ≈øtronge≈øt of all the proper Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> yea almo≈øt equal to all the re≈øt put together. They ari≈øe clo≈øe one to the other from the inner hollow and middle part of the <hi>Thyreoides</hi> or Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, who≈øe inner Cavity they fill through the whole length of it, and with oblique Fibres they a≈øcend upward, growing narrower in their a≈øcent, till they come to their in≈øertion into the ≈øides of the Ewer-like Gri≈øtle. The≈øe are the Mu≈øcles that are principally affected in Humane Bodies when they are in the greate≈øt danger from that Di≈øea≈øe called the Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy or Quin≈øie. For when the≈øe Mu≈øcles are inflamed, they ≈øwell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the Throttle, and make the Cavity thereof ≈øo ≈øtrait, that the Patient cannot fetch his breath, but is ≈øtrangled.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> and la≈øt is reckoned but for one ≈øingle Mu≈øcle, and is called <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> al≈øo <hi>Claudens ≈øecundum,</hi> or the ≈øecond Shutting-mu≈øcle. They take their ri≈øe from the hinder line of the Ewer-like Gri≈øtle or <hi>Ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenoides</hi> from whence it hath its name. It is very ≈ømall but fle≈øhy, and running with tran≈øver≈øe Fibres, it is in≈øerted into the ≈øides of the ≈øame Gri≈øtle, which it helps to con≈øtringe or draw both its ≈øides together, and ≈øo ≈øtraitens the Throttle.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Epiglottis</hi> or Throat-flap, that covers the Chink of the <hi>Larynx</hi> has no di≈øcernible Mu≈øcles in Man, nor I believe in an Hor≈øe: but in Cattle, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that chew the Cud, it is ≈øaid to have evident ones; ≈øome of which ≈øpring from the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> and are in≈øerted into the ba≈øis of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which they lift up; and others are placed between the Coat and Gri≈øtle of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> helping it to ≈øhut the <hi>Larynx.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Uvula hath two Mu≈øcles. 1. Pterygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaphilinus externus. 2. Pterygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaphilinus internus.

Stylopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryngaeum. 4. The Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Oe≈øopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaeus. Two pair of Mu≈øcles late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out by Doctor Croune, viz. Pterygo-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latini, and Spheno-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latini.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> is ≈øaid to have two Mu≈øcles to hold it up, <hi>one</hi> of which is called <hi>Pterygo≈øtaphilinus externus.</hi> This ≈øpringeth from the upper Jaw a little beyond the furthermo≈øt Grinder, and is in≈øerted into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Pterygo≈øtaphilinus internus.</hi> This proceeds from the lower part of the inner Wing of the Proce≈øs <hi>Pterygoides</hi> (or Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) and is in≈øerted in like manner as the former into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the de≈øcription that Anatomi≈øts commonly give of the≈øe two Mu≈øcles; but it may be que≈øtion'd whether they are any more than ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ones; for ≈øeeing the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> has no apparent voluntary motion, it ≈øeems to have no occa≈øion for any Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>Next to the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> come tho≈øe of the <hi>Throat</hi> (or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Gullet called <hi>Pharynx</hi>) to be treated of, to which belong ≈øeven Mu≈øcles, that is, three pair and a Sphincter. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the pairs is called <hi>Sphenopharyngaeum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe thin and nervous from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of the Wedgelike-bone, de≈øcending by the inward Cavity of its
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57416:120"/>Wing-like Proce≈ø≈øes, and are in≈øerted into the lateral parts of the Palate and <hi>Pharynx,</hi> which they widen in ≈øwallowing.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>next</hi> pair is called <hi>Cephalopharyngaeum.</hi> The≈øe ≈øpring from that part where the <hi>Head</hi> is joined to the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, from whence they de≈øcend to the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> into which they are ≈øpread with a large <hi>plexus</hi> of Fibres, which ≈øeemeth to make its Membrane. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this pair is contrary to the former; for as tho≈øe widen the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx</hi> to let the nouri≈øhment de≈øcend into the Gullet, ≈øo the≈øe ≈øtraiten it when the Food is pa≈øt by it, and thereby ≈øqueeze the Food down the Gullet.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Stylopharyngaeum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe with a ≈ømall beginning from the inner part of the <hi>Styloides</hi> Proce≈øs of the Temple-bone, and de≈øcending with a thin body are in≈øerted into the ≈øides of the <hi>Pharynx</hi> which they dilate or widen.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>la≈øt</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is that which hath no fellow, and is called <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophagiaeus,</hi> or the Sphincter of the Gullet. This ari≈øes at one ≈øide of the <hi>Thyreoides,</hi> or Shield-fa≈øhioned Gri≈øtle, and is in≈øerted into the other ≈øide of the ≈øame, wholly encompa≈ø≈øing in its cour≈øe both the fore and back part of the Gullet, in the ≈øame manner as the Sphincters of the <hi>Anus</hi> and Bladder do tho≈øe Parts, ≈øerving here for the ≈øame u≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> to draw or pur≈øe in the mouth of the Gullet, as tho≈øe do the Ar≈øe and Bladder. Now though I have the warrant of ≈øeveral Authours in de≈øcribing of this Mu≈øcle la≈øt of the ≈øeven, yet there be others that treat fir≈øt of it, and reckon it the fir≈øt Mu≈øcle of the Throat, ≈øaying, that if you fir≈øt rai≈øe this, the two next before-mentioned pairs, namely, the <hi>Stylopharyngaeum</hi> and the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalopharyngaeum,</hi> may be the better found.</p>
                        <p>Having done with the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula</hi> and Throat, as al≈øo with all the Mu≈øcles of the inward and outward Parts of the Mouth and Chaps, according as they are treated of by the Ancient and Modern Anatomizers of the≈øe Parts; it remains now that I ≈øhould de≈øcend to the Mu≈øcles of the Head and Neck, and ≈øo to the inferiour Parts; but before I depart quite from hence, I think it nece≈ø≈øary to give the Reader an account of two pair of Mu≈øcles more, which belong to the Palate of the Mouth, never treated of by any Anatomi≈øt yet, ≈øave Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who in his Book of the Mu≈øcles lately ≈øet forth, gives the fir≈øt account of them, at the de≈øire of the di≈øcoverer of them, which was the mo≈øt ingenious Doctor <hi>Croune</hi> now living, and at this time Lecturer at Chirurgeons Hall in <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This worthy and learned Di≈øcoverer hath given them the≈øe names fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; the fir≈øt he calls <hi>Mu≈øculi Pterygo-palatini,</hi> and the other <hi>Spheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palatini.</hi>

The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to depre≈øs the before-named Gland of the Palate and the <hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The latter of them, which he calls <hi>Spheno-palatini,</hi> have an u≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> to lift up the fore-mentioned Gland and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula.</hi> Their ri≈øe is from the <hi>Os ≈øphenoides</hi> or Wedge-like Bone, and their in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (with a broader Tendon than the former) into the ≈øides of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Gland and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula.</hi> It is believed from the ≈øituation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this la≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles, that when the Rheum that had ≈øwelled the

                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>vula,</hi> is drained away, the≈øe Mu≈øcles help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>

                           <p>The Head hath eight pair of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Mu≈øcles. 1. Ma≈øtoide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 2. Splenium. 3. Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xum. 4.

From the≈øe originals they a≈øcend obliquely upwards by the Neck, till they come to the hinder part of the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Mammillary Proce≈øs of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-bone, into which each is in≈øerted by a round and fle≈øhy Tendon. If both the≈øe Mu≈øcles work together, then they bend the Head right forward or downward; but if one onely works, then that draws the Head a little to one ≈øide. Of all the eight pair there are onely this that bend the Head ≈øtreight forward, and that are placed in the fore-part of the Neck; for all the re≈øt are ≈øeated behind towards the Mane, and do either pull the Head back, or el≈øe to one ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair (or fir≈øt pullers back of the Head) is called <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> The≈øe are long and thick, ari≈øing from the five uppermo≈øt <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of the Che≈øt and five lowermo≈øt of the Neck, with a nervous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; from whence a≈øcending to the hinder part of the Head, they there end with a broad and fle≈øhy Tendon. The u≈øe of the≈øe, if both of them act together, is to draw the Head directly backward; but if either of them act ≈øingly, then it draws the Head a little to one ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair, (being the ≈øecond puller back of the Head) is called <hi>Complexum</hi> or <hi>Trigeminum,</hi> becau≈øe each Mu≈øcle ≈øeems to con≈øi≈øt of three, for it ari≈øes with three heads; one of which is from the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈øs of the fourth and fifth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt; the ≈øecond from the fir≈øt and ≈øecond of the ≈øame, and the third from the ridge of the ≈øeventh <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra</hi> of the Neck: all which uniting into one body, the Mu≈øcles a≈øcend upward as far as to the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Noll-bone, (in their cour≈øe becoming fle≈øhy and broad) and are in≈øerted into the ≈øaid Noll-bone, at the root of the Mammillary Proce≈øs, ≈øometimes by one, and ≈øometimes by a triple Tendon.</p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57416:121"/>
                        <p>The third puller back of the Head, or <hi>fourth</hi> pair, is called <hi>parvum &amp; cra≈ø≈øum,</hi> becau≈øe they are ≈ømall and thick. The≈øe are ≈øituated under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ari≈øing from the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the ≈øix uppermo≈øt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, with a nervous beginning; but afterward becoming fle≈øhy, they are carried obliquely upward, and are in≈øerted into the hindermo≈øt root of the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus Mammillaris.</hi> Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is, if they act both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to bring the Head lightly backwards; and if but one act, then to bring it backward to one ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> pair is called <hi>Rectum majus</hi> or the greater right pair, being ≈ømall, fle≈øhy and ≈ølender, and ari≈øing from the tip of the Spine or ridge of the ≈øecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, where they touch one another; but pre≈øently part, and a≈øcending both upward, end with a round Tendon in the middle of the Noll-bone or <hi>Occiput.</hi> The action of this pair is the ≈øame as of the former.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øixth</hi> pair (being the fifth of the pullers back) is called <hi>Rectum minus,</hi> or the le≈ø≈øer right pair. Their ≈øituation is ju≈øt under the former pair, as it were concealed, and are of the like ≈øub≈øtance, form and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs. They ari≈øe clo≈øe together from the back-part of the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck where the Bone ≈øhould have ended in a Spine, but that Spine is wanting becau≈øe it would have offended the former pair of Mu≈øcles that ≈øpring from the ≈øecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> and march over this. Pre≈øently after their original they part, and a≈øcend upwards, and on either ≈øide are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Noll-bone. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe is to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the motion of the two foregoing pair. Now the rea≈øon why there are ≈øo many Mu≈øcles appointed to move the Head backward, and but one pair forward, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Head by rea≈øon of its great bulk and weight, is prone enough of it ≈øelf to incline forward or downward; but it requireth a great force to move it upward or backward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øeventh</hi> pair is called <hi>Obliquum ≈øuperius,</hi> or the upper Oblique pair. The≈øe are ≈øeated under the right or ≈øtreight pairs, and are like them in form and ≈øub≈øtance. They are ≈ømall, ari≈øing out of the middle of the <hi>Occiput</hi> at the out≈øide of the ≈øtreight pairs, from whence they de≈øcend downwards, and are in≈øerted into the tips of the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, the right-hand Mu≈øcle into the right Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs, and the left into the left. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe, if they both act toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to nodd the Head gently directly backwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>eighth</hi> pair is called <hi>Obliquum inferius,</hi> or the lower Oblique pair. The≈øe ari≈øe from the Spine or ridge of the ≈øecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, from whence running obliquely upwards, they end at the tran≈øver≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øes of the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. They are longi≈øh, round and fle≈øhy, and make (as do al≈øo the former) a Triangle of equal ≈øides.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to move the Head as it were ≈øemicircularly, (for it cannot be moved quite round) the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> turning upon the Tooth-like Proce≈øs of the ≈øecond: but this motion is performed, when one of them onely acts at a time; for if both of them move or act toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they either keep the Head ≈øteady (as ≈øome Authours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) or el≈øe draw it a very little backwards.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Mu≈øcles of the Neck.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Mu≈øcles common to the Head and Neck are four pair. 1. Spinatum. 2. Tran≈øver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øale. 3. Longum. 4. Scalenum.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Head is not onely moved by its <hi>proper</hi> Mu≈øcles mentioned in the la≈øt Chapter, primarily; but ≈øecondarily al≈øo by other Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles belonging to the <hi>Neck,</hi> which are in number eight, on each ≈øide four, by the help of which the Neck is ≈øometimes bent forward, other times extended backward; it is al≈øo ≈øometimes drawn to one ≈øide, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the other: but there are more Mu≈øcles to draw it backwards than either forwards or to one ≈øide, becau≈øe the labour is greater by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the weight of the Head and Neck (as was ≈øaid in the former Chapter.) There are therefore two pair of Mu≈øcles to bend the Neck backward, namely the fir≈øt and ≈øecond, which do al≈øo draw it a little obliquely; and the third and fourth pair draw it both forward and to one ≈øide, as both act together, or but one of each pair at a time.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair of the≈øe is called <hi>Spinatum,</hi> becau≈øe they are ≈øeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the Spines of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> They ari≈øe from the roots of the Spines of the ≈øeven uppermo≈øt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt, and five lowermo≈øt of the Neck, being ≈øeparated from one another onely by the tips of the Spines, and are in≈øerted into the whole lower ≈øide of the Spine of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. They bend the Neck backward, or a little obliquely. Some think that they have no original from the Spines of the Neck, but that they onely adhere to them in their pa≈ø≈øage.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>next</hi> pair is called <hi>Tran≈øver≈øale,</hi> becau≈øe they both ri≈øe from and are in≈øerted into the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> They take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the roots of the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the ≈øix uppermo≈øt <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt; from whence a≈øcending by degrees they become ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thicker, and are in≈øerted into the out≈øides of all the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the Neck-bones. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair, as al≈øo of the former, is as hath been ≈øaid, to pull or draw the Neck directly backwards; but if one Mu≈øcle of either pair work alone, it pulls the Neck with an oblique motion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is called <hi>Longum,</hi> or the Long pair. The≈øe lie hid under the <hi>Oe≈øophagus</hi> or Gullet, wherefore they are by ≈øome called the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gullet-lurkers. They ari≈øe with a thin and ≈øharp but fle≈øhy beginning from the body of the fifth and ≈øixth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, and as they a≈øcend upwards, are knit to the ≈øides of all the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> till they come to the fir≈øt or highe≈øt of the Neck, where each touching other they are both in≈øerted into its Proce≈øs. The u≈øe of this pair, when they work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is to bend the Neck directly forward, and withall to incline the Head; but if one of them act alone, then is the Neck drawn towards that ≈øide on which the Mu≈øcle moveth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and la≈øt pair of the Mu≈øcles of the Neck is called <hi>Scalenum</hi> or <hi>Triangulare.</hi> The≈øe by ≈øome Authours are accounted as the eighth pair of the Che≈øt. They are ≈øeated on the ≈øides of the Neck inclining rather to the fore than hinder part of it. They take their beginning from the fir≈øt Rib, ari≈øing fle≈øhy and large, and are in≈øerted into the in≈øide of all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57416:122"/>the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is the ≈øame with the foregoing pair. They are ob≈øerved to be perforated or to have holes through them, by which Veins, Arteries and Nerves do pa≈øs out of the Body into the Fore-legs.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Mu≈øcles of the Brea≈øt.</head>
                        <p>HAving di≈øpatched the Mu≈øcles of the Head and Neck, we come in the next place to ≈øpeak to tho≈øe of the Che≈øt or <hi>Thorax,</hi> in which are contained the principal In≈øtruments of Life, the Heart and Lungs. Now the Lungs being the principal organs of Re≈øpiration, and wanting Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whereby to dilate or contract them≈øelves, it was nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould receive a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the Che≈øt in which they are included, by the dilatation or contraction whereof, they might be al≈øo dilated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. To which end the Che≈øt is furni≈øhed with ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles, ≈øome of which contract it in Expiration, that is, when the Hor≈øe lets forth his breath, and others dilate it in In≈øpiration, when he receives in his breath.</p>
                        <p>Of the Dilaters or tho≈øe that widen the Che≈øt there are four pair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the ≈øixteen pair of the External Interco≈øtals, there being (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øaid in Chap. 2. of the Second Book where I largely treated of them) between each Rib two Mu≈øcles, an External and an Internal one. Now there being in number ≈øeventeen Ribs, reckoning a Rib for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme part both toward the Neck and toward the Flank, there mu≈øt be one pair of Mu≈øcles fewer than there are Ribs, of which tho≈øe that are ≈øeated externally, ≈øerve all as one Mu≈øcle to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the widening or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Che≈øt, and tho≈øe that are ≈øeated internally (lying under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the contraction of it. For a more full de≈øcription of the≈øe Mu≈øcles you may plea≈øe to turn back to the afore-cited Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair of the dilating or widening Mu≈øcles is called <hi>Subclavium,</hi>from their ≈øituation, which is under the Collar-bone called <hi>Clavicula,</hi> for they fill up that ≈øpace that is between the Clavicle and the fir≈øt Rib. The≈øe ari≈øe fle≈øhy from the inner and lower part of the Clavicle or Collar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, which is next to the Rib, and running obliquely or ≈ølanting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, are implanted into the fir≈øt Rib near the Brea≈øt-bone with a fle≈øhy end. The action of this pair of Mu≈øcles is to draw the fir≈øt Rib upwards and outwards, by which motion the cavity of the Che≈øt is widened.</p>
                        <p>The next or <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair of the Dilaters is called <hi>Serratum majus Anticum,</hi> or the greater and foremo≈øt Saw-like pair, ≈øo called partly from their ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and magnitude, and partly from the figure of their Tendons which re≈øemble the teeth of a Saw. They ari≈øe from the in≈øide of the Shoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blade and the two upper Ribs, and are in≈øerted into the lower five True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribs and two upper ba≈øtard or Short-ribs, before they end into Gri≈øtles; ≈øo that its breadth takes up a great part of the ≈øide of the Che≈øt, and it is al≈øo very fle≈øhy. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair of Mu≈øcles is to draw the Ribs outwards and upwards, and ≈øo to dilate or widen the Che≈øt, which it doth more e≈øpecially in great and violent ≈øtrainings.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third proper</hi> pair of the Mu≈øcles of the Che≈øt is called the upper backward Saw-pair, or <hi>Serratum po≈øticum ≈øuperius.</hi> They are ≈øeated on the Back under the Mu≈øcle called <hi>Rhomboides</hi> or the fourth Mu≈øcle of the Shoulder-blade, betwixt both the Blades, and above the fir≈øt pair of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57416:124"/>Head. They ≈øpring membranous from the Spines of the three lower Rack-bones of the Neck and the fir≈øt of the Back, and are in≈øerted into the Inter≈øtices of three or four of the upper Ribs. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is the ≈øame as of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> to draw the Ribs upward, whereby the Che≈øt is dilated, and the inner Cavity thereof inlarged.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Serratum po≈øticum inferius,</hi> the lower backward Saw-pair. The≈øe are ≈øeated almo≈øt in the middle of the Back, under the broad Mu≈øcle that is the fir≈øt of the Depre≈ø≈øors of the Shoulder. They ari≈øe from the Spines of the three lowe≈øt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back and of the fir≈øt of the Loins, with a membranous, nervous and broad beginning; afterwards they pa≈øs with an overthwart line cro≈øs the Mu≈øcles of the Back, and being increa≈øed with fle≈øhy Fibres are in≈øerted into three or four of the lower ≈øhort Ribs before they turn into Gri≈øtles. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to draw the three or four lowe≈øt Ribs outwards, and ≈øo to dilate or widen the lower part of the Che≈øt.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the four pair already named there is yet another Mu≈øcle that a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts the≈øe in the motion of widening the Che≈øt in In≈øpiration, which is the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Midriff, of which I have already ≈øpoken in its proper place, namely in the fourth Chapter of the Second Book; I ≈øhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omit ≈øpeaking of it any farther here.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to treat of the Mu≈øcles that <hi>contract</hi> or ≈øtraiten the Che≈øt in Expiration or letting forth the breath. The fir≈øt pair of the≈øe is called <hi>par Triangulare,</hi> or triangled pair, though they make not a perfect triangle, becau≈øe they con≈øi≈øt of two long ≈øides and one ≈øhort one. The≈øe ari≈øe from the middle line of the Brea≈øt-bone on the in≈øide of it, (for their ≈øeat is within the Cavity of the Che≈øt, under the Brea≈øt-bone) being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ≈ølender, and are in≈øerted into the bony ends of the third, fourth, fifth and ≈øixth True-ribs (where they are fa≈øtned to the Gri≈øtles.) The u≈øe of this pair is to draw the Ribs toward the Brea≈øt-bone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ≈øtraiten the Che≈øt in Expiration.</p>
                        <p>The next is called <hi>Sacrolumbum</hi> from their ri≈øe, which is from the <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> and from the Spine or ridge of the <hi>Lumbi</hi> or Loins. They are ≈øeated under the <hi>Serratum po≈øticum inferius,</hi> and creeping upwards mix them≈øelves with the long Mu≈øcle of the Back, and al≈øo fa≈øten them≈øelves to the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the Racks of the Loins as far as to the lowe≈øt Rack of the Che≈øt, from whence a≈øcending up to the Ribs, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted into the lower ≈øide of them all by a particular Tendon about three or four fingers breadth from the ridge of the Back. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair according to <hi>Ve≈ølingius,</hi> is to contract the Che≈øt; but <hi>Spigelius</hi> and al≈øo <hi>Bartholinus</hi> do believe that becau≈øe it grows out of the ≈øame beginning with the long Mu≈øcle of the Back, therefore it extends and rai≈øes up the Che≈øt as that doth.</p>
                        <p>There is another pair oppo≈øite to this de≈øcribed by <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Anatomi≈øt, who hath given them the name of <hi>Cervicale de≈øcendens.</hi> The≈øe, ≈øays he, do ≈øpring from the third, fourth, fifth, ≈øixth and ≈øeventh <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neek, and are in≈øerted into the upper ≈øide of each Rib, as the <hi>Sacrolumbum</hi> is into the Lower; and ≈øays, that this pair by pulling the Ribs upwards in In≈øpiration widen the Che≈øt, as the other by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them down in Expiration ≈øtraiten it.</p>
                        <p>To the Mu≈øcles already ≈øpoken of, which do contract the Che≈øt, do belong the ≈øixteen <hi>Internal Interco≈øtal</hi> Mu≈øcles: For as the <hi>External</hi> ones a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Wideners or Dilaters of the Che≈øt in their motions, ≈øo do the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57416:124"/>
                           <hi>Internal</hi> al≈øo a≈ø≈øi≈øt the≈øe contracting Mu≈øcles in the drawing together of the Che≈øt, and do all act together as one Mu≈øcle, as the others do; for they pa≈øs obliquely from the lower to the upper Ribs, as the others did from the upper to the lower, their Fibres running contrary to or acro≈øs the former. All the≈øe Mu≈øcles are ≈øaid, ≈øecondarily, to be a≈ø≈øi≈øted in their motion by the Abdominal Mu≈øcles, as al≈øo by the Mu≈øcles of the Shoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blade and Fore-legs.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Mu≈øcles of the Back have but one motion. Four pair of the Back and Loins. 1. Mu≈øculi longi≈ø≈øimi. 2. Par Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratum. 3. Sacri. 4. Par Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpinatum. The di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per called a ≈øway'd Back is oftner an affection of the≈øe Mu≈øcles, than any di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location in the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Back,</hi> as al≈øo of the whole Spine, are ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øly and intricately intermixed and knit together, that ≈øome Anatomi≈øts have divided them into more, others into fewer, and that by rea≈øon of the infinite originals of the Fibres and the multitude of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertions, all which the admirable wi≈øedom of Nature thought fit to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and knit one within another, that they might the better and with the more ≈øtrength ≈øu≈øtain and accompli≈øh tho≈øe ≈øtrong and violent actions to which they are de≈øign'd, and al≈øo with more ea≈øe and ≈øafety bear ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heavy weights, as this noble Animal, the ≈øubject of my Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, doth continually undergo. For if <hi>power united be the ≈øtronger,</hi> (as the common ≈øaying is) then certainly if many Mu≈øcles con≈øpire together unto one motion, they will be better able to perform it.</p>
                        <p>Now that there are not more than one apparent motion performed by the Mu≈øcles of the Back of an Hor≈øe is plain, which motion is by the help of the Back-bones to rai≈øe up and ≈øu≈øpend as it were the whole bulk of the Body, and to bear al≈øo great weights many times upon it: I ≈øay this is the main, if not the onely motion performed by the≈øe Mu≈øcles; for the Bodies of Hor≈øes cannot be turned backwards and forwards, to the ≈øides, and almo≈øt ≈øemicircularly, as the Backs of Men are, as may be ≈øeen in Dancers, Tumblers and the like.</p>
                        <p>Again, the≈øe Mu≈øcles though they are by later Anatomi≈øts divided into ≈øeveral pairs, yet the Ancients (as <hi>Galen</hi> for one) were of opinion, that ≈øeeing they cannot be by any means truly ≈øeparated, either there mu≈øt be ≈øo many pair as there are Rack-bones, or el≈øe (which is more likely) that there is but one onely pair, offering tendinous di≈øtributions to all the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back. And ≈øays <hi>Galen,</hi> If one of this pair work alone, the Spine is inclined towards that ≈øide, be it the right or left; but if they both work together, the Spine is bended to neither hand, but pulled ≈øtreight backward, or rather the Spines are held in their ≈øeveral proper places. And, adds he, whereas almo≈øt all Mu≈øcles have their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoni≈øts, that are the Authours of a contrary action to theirs, yet the≈øe Mu≈øcles of the Spine (if you except the bending Mu≈øcles of the Neck) have no Antagoni≈øts or Oppo≈øites.</p>
                        <p>Neither are the≈øe Mu≈øcles of the Back proper to the Back alone,but common to the <hi>Loins</hi> al≈øo, being reckoned their ≈øecond pair, of which I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57416:125"/>will fir≈øt treat though it be contrary to the cu≈øtom of Anatomi≈øts to doe ≈øo This pair then goes by the name of <hi>Ma≈øculi longi≈ø≈øimi,</hi> ≈øo called from their extraordinary length, as being the longe≈øt Mu≈øcles (and al≈øo the ≈øtronge≈øt) in the whole Body. For they ari≈øe from the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> and <hi>Ileium</hi> or Haunch-bone, and pa≈ø≈øing along by the Spine or ridge of the Loins, Back and Neck, they reach as far as to the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus Mammilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> or Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes of the Temple-bones. They are almo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the <hi>Sacrolumbum</hi> and <hi>Semi≈øpinatum</hi> in their march through the Loins, whence by ≈øome tho≈øe are taken to be parts of this pair: but as ≈øoon as this pair arrives at the Back, it parts with tho≈øe, and appears to be di≈øtinct from them. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is (if they act together) directly to extend the Back and Loins; but if one onely work, then is the Spine inclined on one ≈øide, for their Fibres are oblique or ≈ølanting.</p>
                        <p>The next pair goes by the name of <hi>Quadratum</hi> or the Square pair, from their Figure; for whil≈øt they are in their natural ≈øituation they both of them together make a four-≈øquare figure, though when they are ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they are each of a triangular ≈øhape. They ari≈øe broad, thick and fle≈øhy from the backward and upper Cavity of the Haunch-bone, and from the inner and upper ≈øide of <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> and remaining fle≈øhy in their whole cour≈øe, they are in≈øerted into all the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins as far as the lowe≈øt Rib. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to bend the Racks of the Loins with a right motion forward or downward; but if one of them work alone, it draws the Loins to one ≈øide a little down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>The next are the Mu≈øcles called <hi>Sacri,</hi> or holy Mu≈øcles, from their ri≈øe, which is from the <hi>Os ≈øacrum.</hi> They ≈øpring with an acute original from that part of the ≈øaid Bone where the Spine is fa≈øtned to the Haunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. After their original they grow broad by degrees, and though they end not till they come to the Spine of the lowe≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> yet in their progre≈øs they are in≈øerted into ≈øeveral of the Spines and oblique Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, their Fibres running obliquely or with a ≈ølanting line upwards and inwards. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair, if one work alone, is to pull the Body a little on one ≈øide, but if both act or work together, they extend that part of the Spine to which they are fa≈øtned.</p>
                        <p>The la≈øt pair is called <hi>Semi≈øpinatum.</hi> The≈øe ari≈øe with a nervous original or beginning from all the Spines or Ridges of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> and the Loins, and are in≈øerted into the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins and ≈øome of the lowermo≈øt of the Che≈øt. The≈øe with the former pair do fill up the di≈øtances between the Spines, where they touch one another, nothing coming between them to ≈øeparate them from one another, but a membranous Ligament i≈ø≈øuing from the upper Spine. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to join the Spines together, and to extend or erect that part of the Back to which they grow. Now if all the≈øe Mu≈øcles of the Back and Loins work together, the whole Back is extended, or in a manner drawn backwards: but if the Mu≈øcles of one ≈øide work alone, the Body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to that ≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Mu≈øcles are apt to have their tone and ≈øtrength violated by ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral accidents, as by over-great Loads, by a ≈øudden Gold taken by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off the Saddle after hard riding before the Hor≈øe be quite cold, and the like; whereby the Mu≈øcles become benumbed and relaxed, and ≈øo are in a manner deprived of both ≈øen≈øe and motion; by which means the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57416:125"/>Hor≈øe becomes u≈øele≈øs, being ≈øo far from being able to carry Burthens or to perform any other ≈øervice for his Ma≈øter, that when he is up he can hardly ≈øerve him≈øelf, I mean, ≈øtand to eat his Meat; or if down, not able to ri≈øe without help. This al≈øo often happens to old and lean Hor≈øes, in whom by rea≈øon of the weakne≈øs of their Bodies, as al≈øo becau≈øe they abound with flegmatick Humours, the≈øe Mu≈øcles are ≈øo relaxt that they are ≈øcarce able to ≈øupport the weight of their own Bodies, much le≈øs other Burthens. And in this ca≈øe I think nothing more proper than good ≈øtore of ≈øtrengthening Food, to ≈øupport and nouri≈øh their in≈øide, whereby they may gain ≈øtrength, and withall to apply ≈øome ≈øtrengthening Pla≈øter to the out≈øide at the ≈øame time.</p>
                        <p>But to recover tho≈øe that come by this affection by great Colds taken as is above-mentioned, it will be the be≈øt way to give them warm, ≈øtrengthening and comfortable Medicines inwardly, and al≈øo to apply fir≈øt ≈øome warm Sheep-skins pretty often renewed, and at the ≈øame time to anoint the Loins with ≈øome ≈øovereign Ointments or Oyles out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; or if this will not doe, then to ≈øweat him in a Dunghill, and after he comes out, to apply to the Loins a ≈øtrengthening Charge or Pla≈øter.</p>
                        <p>I thought my ≈øelf a little obliged in this place to inlarge upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to undeceive many of our Profe≈ø≈øors, who take all Di≈øtempers in this kind to be as one, concluding ≈øtill that all Hor≈øes thus affected, are either ≈øtrained in the Kidneys or ≈øwayed, as we call it, in the Back; when indeed the≈øe Mu≈øcles are either benumbed by cold as afore≈øaid, or by ≈øtrains gotten by carrying over-great weights or burthens, they are di≈øtended to that degree, that for ≈øome time they lo≈øe the ≈øtrength and vigor they u≈øed to perform their motions with; this, I ≈øay, is often the true cau≈øe of the debility and weakne≈øs of the Back.</p>
                        <p>Not that I will deny that there is any ≈øuch malady as a ≈øwayed Back, for I have my ≈øelf by di≈ø≈øection ≈øeen in a Hor≈øe that was knocked on the Head, (being not curable of this Di≈øtemper) not onely all the mu≈øcular Parts as it were brui≈øed, and many of their inter≈øpaces filled with a kind of a congealed Humour or Matter, but al≈øo found a kind of di≈ølocation in that part where the <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> or lowe≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Loins are joined, and a deal of congealed Matter ≈øettled about tho≈øe Parts. But ≈øuch a ≈øtrain is ≈øeldom curable, or if ever, not without great charge and long keeping. What I have therefore ≈øaid upon this account is to let our Profe≈ø≈øors know, that mo≈øt of tho≈øe affections which they call ≈øway'd Backs are onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempers of the Mu≈øcles, and therefore ea≈øily cured if ≈øoon taken in hand: but tho≈øe which have broken Backs, (which we commonly under≈øtand by ≈øwayed Backs) are ≈øeldom curable. And thus much ≈øhall ≈øuffice as to this ≈øort of di≈øcour≈øe in this place; it remains now that I return to my former di≈øcour≈øe, and de≈øcribe the remaining part of the Mu≈øcles, of which tho≈øe of the <hi>Anus,</hi> Bladder, and Genitals both in Hor≈øes and Mares come next to be ≈øpoken to.</p>

                        <p>AHor≈øe being a Creature made for ≈øervice, it was fit that he ≈øhould void his Excrements at his own conveniency and choice, and not perpetually; As therefore Nature hath provided Mu≈øcles about the Mouth and Chaps for the receiving, chewing and ≈øwallowing of the Food, ≈øo at the end of the Guts and at the outlet of the Urine there are Mu≈øcles ≈øet as Porters to interclude the pa≈ø≈øage, that nothing might go out but by the Hor≈øe's own accord; whereas were it not for the≈øe Mu≈øcles, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements would come from him continually and involuntarily, as I have ≈øeen to happen in ≈øuch Hor≈øes who≈øe Sphincter Mu≈øcle hath by ≈øome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or extraordinary weakne≈øs been violated. Neither hath Nature onely provided Mu≈øcles for the keeping of the Excrements in, I mean till ≈øuch time as it is nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould be let forth; but others al≈øo as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the voiding or letting of them forth. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpo≈øe is appointed one Mu≈øcle at the <hi>Anus</hi> called the Sphincter, and for the latter, two, called Levators.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sphincter</hi> is a fle≈øhy Mu≈øcle ≈øeated at the very end of the Ar≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut, the which it incompa≈ø≈øeth round like a Ring, to which it may fitly be re≈øembled. It is rather knit to than ari≈øes from the lower <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> being round and broad, and furni≈øhed with tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe or overthwart Fibres, or indeed orbicular ones. This Mu≈øcle is much thicker above or inwards, than below or at the Fundament, where it adheres ≈øo firmly to the Skin, that it is not ea≈øie to ≈øeparate it from it. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> we have mentioned in the former Paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The other two are called the <hi>Levators</hi> or litters up of the Fundament.The≈øe are ≈ømall, broad and nervous, ari≈øing from the Ligaments of the Hip-bones and <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> from whence pa≈ø≈øing by the ≈øides of the ≈øtreight or Ar≈øe-gut they adhere to it, and are in≈øerted into the upper part of the Sphincter. A portion of them al≈øo grows to the root of the Yard, and in Mares to the neck of the Matrix. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Abdominal Mu≈øcles in the expul≈øion of the Excrements, which they doe by lifting up the Fundament. They al≈øo help to keep the Fundament from falling out, which ≈øometimes happens when they are too much relaxt.</p>
                        <p>To the <hi>Bladder</hi> doth al≈øo belong a Mu≈øcle called a <hi>Sphincter,</hi> which is ≈øeated in the beginning of its neck, the which it compa≈ø≈øeth round. It is furni≈øhed with orbicular Fibres as the Sphincter of the Fundament is, and is of the ≈øame u≈øe; for it con≈øtringes or pur≈øes up the neck of the Bladder (as that doth the <hi>Anus</hi>) that the Urine may not pa≈øs out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ≈øpontaneous relaxing of this Mu≈øcle. In Mares it is ≈øeated at the very end of the Bladder, <hi>viz.</hi> at the hole where the neck of the Bladder opens into the <hi>Vagina.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Tard</hi> are in number four (or two pair) of which we have already treated in the Fir≈øt Book at Chapter 20. of which the fir≈øt pair are called the <hi>Erectores</hi> or Lifters up of the Yard, and the other
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57416:126"/>
                           <hi>Dilatantes,</hi> Wideners, and by ≈øome they are called <hi>Acceleratores</hi> or Ha≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I thought fit in this place onely to name them, referring the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the above-named Chapter for his farther ≈øatisfaction; as al≈øo to the ≈øaid Book at Chap. 22. for the de≈øcription of the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Te≈øticles</hi> called the <hi>Crema≈øter</hi> Mu≈øcles, by which the Te≈øticles are ≈øu≈øpended. The Reader may al≈øo be ≈øatisfied in the ≈øame Book at Chap. 27. concerning the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Clitoris</hi> in Mares, which are two pair, as the Yard of a Hor≈øe, to which it is re≈øembled, hath; for I ≈øhall not in≈øi≈øt upon <hi>them</hi> in this place neither.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade hath four pair. 1. Cuculla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 2. Levato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 3. Serratum minus Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum. 4. Rhombo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving ≈øufficiently treated of the Mu≈øcles of the three <hi>Venters,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that I de≈øcend now to treat of tho≈øe of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> beginning fir≈øt with the formo≈øt of them, the fir≈øt of which ≈øhall be tho≈øe that move the <hi>Shoulder-blade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Shoulder-blade</hi> is ob≈øerved to have four motions, <hi>viz.</hi> forward, backward, upward and downward, which motions are performed by four pair of proper Mu≈øcles. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> pair are ≈øeated betwixt the two Shoulder-blades, covering the top of the Withers. They are called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullares</hi> from the re≈øemblance they have with a Monk's Hood or Cowl. Their fir≈øt original is fle≈øhy and thin, which they take from the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hinder part of the Head; but as they de≈øcend down the Neck they have other membranous beginnings from five of the Spines thereof, yea and from eight or nine of the uppermo≈øt of the Che≈øt: but they pre≈øently begin to be ≈øtraitned as they de≈øcend towards the Shoulder-blades, into who≈øe whole ≈øpine or ridge they are implanted, as likewi≈øe into the Shoulder-bone and broader part of the Collar-bone. This pair of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, becau≈øe of their divers originals, from whence they have ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Fibres, are ≈øaid to perform ≈øeveral motions; as when the upper part of the Mu≈øcle that ari≈øes from the <hi>Occiput</hi> is contracted, then is the Shoulder-blade lifted obliquely upward, that part being furni≈øhed with oblique Fibres; and when that part which ≈øprings from the Withers is contracted, then it is pull'd ≈øtreight thitherward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> pair are called <hi>Levatores,</hi> the Lifters or Heavers; and by ≈øome (in Men) <hi>Patientiae Mu≈øculi.</hi> The≈øe are ≈øituated above the Collar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, taking their beginning from the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the fir≈øt, ≈øecond, third and fourth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck; which beginnings being united in the middle (or thereabouts) of the length of the Mu≈øcles, they are at la≈øt in≈øerted into the Shoulder-blades at their fore corner. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the≈øe Mu≈øcles is to draw the Blades upward and forward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> pair is called <hi>Serratum minus Anticum</hi> or the le≈ø≈øer fore Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.The≈øe lie under the Pectoral Mu≈øcles, and ≈øpring from the four upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Ribs before they become gri≈øtly, by four fle≈øhy portions repre≈øenting
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57416:127"/>the teeth of a Saw; from whence they pa≈øs ≈øomewhat ≈ølantingly to the Shoulder-blade, into who≈øe Proce≈øs (called its Anchor-like Proce≈øs) it is in≈øerted with a broad (partly fle≈øhy and partly nervous) Tendon. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this pair is to move the Shoulder-blades forward to the Che≈øt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and la≈øt pair is called <hi>Rhomboides.</hi> The≈øe are ≈øeated under the <hi>Cucullares,</hi> being thin, broad and four-≈øquare. They ≈øpring fle≈øhy from the hinder Proce≈ø≈øes or Spines of the three lowe≈øt Rack-bones of the Neck, and as many of the uppermo≈øt of the Che≈øt, and continuing fle≈øhy to their very in≈øertion they are implanted into the ba≈øis of the Blades. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to draw the Blade ≈øomewhat upward and backward, couching it to the Back.</p>
                        <p>Note, that ≈øeeing a Hor≈øe and all four-footed Bea≈øts go prone, whereas Man walks erect or upright, the motions of the Mu≈øcles might, and ought in ≈øtrictne≈øs, to be explained diver≈øly in <hi>them</hi> from what they are in <hi>him:</hi> As for example, Tho≈øe which are ≈øaid in Man to move the Part upward, <hi>viz.</hi> toward the Head, ought in a four-footed Bea≈øt to be ≈øaid to move it forward; and tho≈øe which move it backward in Man, move it upward in the other, becau≈øe of the different po≈øture of their Bodies: and the ≈øame might be ≈øaid as to their motions forward and backward. But ≈øeeing many of the Mu≈øcles have their names from their offices in <hi>Men,</hi> it would make but a confu≈øion and a great impropriety in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations to explain their motions by other termes in Brutes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reader is de≈øired to ob≈øerve, That when we ≈øay a Part is moved upward, we mean towards the Head; when downward, toward the Tail; when backward, toward the Back; and when forward, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand it toward the Brea≈øt or Belly.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Each Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath nine Mu≈øcles, viz. fir≈øt, two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors. 1 Deltoides. 2 Supra≈øpina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. 1 Secondly, two Depre≈ø≈øors.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT which I call the <hi>Shoulder</hi> is that Part or Bone that reaches from the top or pitch of the Shoulder (and is joynted into the Shoulder-blade) to the next Joint which we call the Elbow; which it is nece≈ø≈øary to intimate for di≈øtinction ≈øake, becau≈øe the Shoulder-blade and this part are commonly both under≈øtood by the name of the Shoulder. Having adverti≈øed this, pa≈øs we now to its Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>The motions of the Shoulders are five, <hi>viz.</hi> backwards, forwards, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, downwards and circularly. To perform which each hath nine Mu≈øcles, of which there are two that move it upward, namely the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides</hi> and <hi>Supra≈øpinatus;</hi> and of the≈øe we ≈øhall treat in the fir≈øt place.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is called <hi>Deltoides</hi> from its figure, which re≈øembles the ≈øhape of the Greek Letter Œî <hi>delta.</hi> It is fle≈øhy and (as you may ≈øee) triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ari≈øing from the mid≈øt of the Clavicle or Collar-bone, the top of the Shoulder, and the whole ridge of the Shoulder-blade, and is extended as far as to the middle of the Shoulder-bone, where it is in≈øerted. This Mu≈øcle is ob≈øerved to have divers ≈øorts of Fibres; ≈øome of which run ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57416:127"/>downwards, ≈øuch are tho≈øe on the fore-part; others run oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, which are tho≈øe on the back-part of it; and a third ≈øort, which are placed in the middle, run directly toward the Fore-leg: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (≈øays my Authour) when the Fibres of the fore-part are contracted, the Shoulder is lifted upward and forward towards the Hor≈øe's No≈øe; if the middle Fibres be contracted, the Shoulder is lifted directly towards his Back; and if the hinder Fibres be contracted, then is the Shoulder carried obliquely backward: ≈øo that this Mu≈øcle is ≈øaid not onely to rai≈øe up the Shoulder (which is indeed its chiefe≈øt u≈øe) but helps al≈øo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form other motions as well as that.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Erector</hi> or Lifter up of the Shoulder is called <hi>Supra≈øpinatus</hi> by ≈øome, but by others <hi>Super≈øcapularis ≈øuperior,</hi> or the upper Blade-rider,becau≈øe it is ≈øeated uppermo≈øt upon the Shoulder-blade, and filleth up all that cavity which is between its ≈øpine and upper edge. It ari≈øes from the ≈øpine of the Blade with a long and fle≈øhy beginning, and pa≈ø≈øing over the jointing of the <hi>Scapula</hi> with the Shoulder-bone by a broad and ≈øtrong Tendon, is in≈øerted into the neck of the ≈øaid Shoulder-bone. This Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is by ≈øome Authours thought not onely to lift up the Shoulder (which is its principal u≈øe, as being one of the Erectors) but al≈øo to help to turn it a little round.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Depre≈ø≈øors</hi> or Pullers down of the Shoulder are al≈øo two, namely <hi>Lati≈ø≈øimus</hi> and <hi>Rotundus major.</hi> The <hi>Lati≈ø≈øimus</hi> is ≈øo called from its breadth and largene≈øs, for with its fellow it covereth almo≈øt the whole Back. It goeth al≈øo by the name of <hi>Ani-≈øcalptor,</hi> or Scratch-ar≈øe Mu≈øcle (in Men.) It ri≈øes with a membranous and broad beginning from the tops of all the ≈øpines of the Rack-bones that are betwixt the ≈øixth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Che≈øt and the middle of <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> as al≈øo from the upper part of <hi>Os ileum</hi> or Haunch-bone: from thence a≈øcending upward untill it come to that part of the Back where the Ribs begin to bend backward, there it becomes more fle≈øhy, and is carried over the lower or hinder corner of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade, at which place it begins to grow narrower but continues fle≈øhy: and at length by a broad and ≈øtrong Tendon it is in≈øerted below the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per head of the Shoulder-bone lengthways, on the in≈øide, betwixt the Pectoral and Round Mu≈øcles, there being a ≈øpace left betwixt them for that purpo≈øe. This draws the Shoulder downward or toward the Tail, though a little obliquely backward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> Puller down of the Shoulder (or its fourth Mu≈øcle) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rotundus major,</hi> or the greater Round Mu≈øcle. It takes its beginning from the whole lower <hi>Co≈øta</hi> or Rib of the Shoulder-blade, and is in≈øerted into the upper and inner part of the Shoulder-bone with a ≈øhort but broad, ≈øtrong and nervous Tendon. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this is the ≈øame with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> to pull the Shoulder downward.</p>
                        <p>The two pair of Mu≈øcles that pull the Shoulder <hi>forward</hi> are called, the one by the name of <hi>Pectoralis,</hi> and the other <hi>Coracoideus.</hi> The <hi>Pectoralis</hi> is ≈øo called from its ≈øituation, which is upon the fore-≈øide of the <hi>Brea≈øt.</hi> It hath a very large and for the greate≈øt part membranous beginning, which it takes from divers parts: for its upper part ari≈øes from the middle of the Collar-bone on that ≈øide next the Brea≈øt; its middle, from the whole length of the Brea≈øt-bone and the ends of the Gri≈øtles of the Ribs that end in it; and its lower part ≈øprings from the Gri≈øtles of the ≈øixth, ≈øeventh and eighth Ribs. After it hath taken the≈øe beginnings, it pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes fle≈øhy and thick, and running towards the Shoulder is at
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57416:128"/>length in≈øerted into the Shoulder-bone with a ≈øhort, but broad, finewy and ≈øtrong Tendon a little below its head, betwixt the Mu≈øcle <hi>Deltoides,</hi> and that which is called <hi>Biceps.</hi> The office of this Mu≈øcle is, when it contracteth it ≈øelf equally, to move the Shoulder equally and directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or toward the Brea≈øt, inclining to neither hand: but if all its Fibres be not equally contracted, (for by rea≈øon of its divers beginnings it hath al≈øo divers ≈øorts of Fibres, ≈øome running with a ≈ølanting line from above downwards, others with the like ≈ølanting line from below upward, and tho≈øe betwixt the≈øe running ≈øtreight; wherefore I ≈øay, if all the≈øe Fibres be not equally contracted, but ≈øome work, and others not) then are other motions performed by this Mu≈øcle, as the Shoulder drawn more upward or downward, as the different Fibres work.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Coracoideus</hi> is by <hi>Bartholin</hi> accounted the ninth Mu≈øcle of the Shoulder (which, ≈øays he, was fir≈øt ob≈øerved by <hi>Arantius</hi> and <hi>Placentinus</hi>) but we do after the more modern Authours reckon it for the ≈øixth, and ≈øecond drawer forward of it. It hath its name <hi>Coracoideus</hi> from its beginning, which is from the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus Coracoides</hi> of the <hi>Scapula;</hi> from whence it reaches to the middle of the Shoulder-bone where it terminates. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is (as ≈øay the di≈øcoverers of it) to draw the Shoulder to the Proce≈øs of the Blade-bone, or forward upon the Brea≈øt.</p>
                        <p>The Shoulder is moved al≈øo <hi>backward</hi> by three Mu≈øcles, which are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra≈øpinatus, Sub≈øcapularis</hi> or <hi>Immer≈øus,</hi> and <hi>Rotundus minor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which is reckoned the fir≈øt of the≈øe, is the <hi>Infra≈øpinatus,</hi> by ≈øome called <hi>Supra≈øcapularis inferior.</hi> It is ≈øeated upon the Shoulder-blade and fills up all that ≈øpace which is betwixt the ridge or ≈øpine of the <hi>Scapula</hi> and its lower edge, even as the <hi>Supra≈øcapularis ≈øuperior</hi> fills up the upper ≈øpace. It ari≈øes fle≈øhy from the ba≈øis of the Blade below the ridge of it, becoming narrower in its progre≈øs as the Blade-bone grows narrower, and is in≈øerted by a broad and ≈øhort Tendon into the fourth Ligament of the Shoulder-bone.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond Puller or Drawer back of the Shoulder is the <hi>Sub≈øcapularis,</hi>the Under-blade-lurker, or <hi>Immer≈øus</hi> the drowned Mu≈øcle, becau≈øe it is ≈øeated under the Blade-bone betwixt the Ribs and it. Very fle≈øhy it is, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing ≈øo from the inner part of the ba≈øis of the Blade; in figure it is trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, like the Bone, growing narrower or ≈øtraiter by degrees as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcends, and is in≈øerted into one of the Ligaments of the Shoulder.</p>
                        <p>The next being the third and la≈øt of the Drawers back of the Shoulder is called <hi>Rotundus minor,</hi> the le≈ø≈øer Round Mu≈øcle, from its figure. It ari≈øes from the lowe≈øt corner of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and is implanted into the neck of the Shoulder-bone.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>circular</hi> motion of the Shoulder, <hi>that</hi> is not performed by any one Mu≈øcle, but by ≈øeveral of the≈øe already named, acting ≈øucce≈ø≈øive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after another.</p>

                        <p>THAT part of the Leg which reaches from the Elbow to that which we call the Knee, an≈øwers to that part in Humane Bodies which reaches from the Elbow to the Wri≈øt. Onely in an Hor≈øe there is but one Bone in this ≈øpace (which we ≈øhall call the Cubit-bone) whereas in Men there are two going by two di≈øtinct names, one of which being the greater is called <hi>Cubitus</hi> or the Cubit, and the other <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lna</hi> or the Ell. But as for that part which we call the Knee, it agrees more exactly with the Wri≈øt in Men, and might more properly be called ≈øo: For examining the Part to ≈øee of what it is compounded, I find it made up of two ranges of little Bones as the Wri≈øt of a Man is, and not like the Knee of a Man; which con≈øi≈øts of one little round Bone (called the Knee-pan) fa≈øtned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jointings of the lower head of the Thigh-bone and the heads of the <hi>tibia</hi> and <hi>fibula:</hi> for that Bone is exactly found in the Hind-leg of a Hor≈øe in that Joint we call the Stifle, which is indeed the Knee, as ≈øhall be proved in a convenient place. And as the Knee of a Hor≈øe is like the Wri≈øt of a Man, ≈øo is that Bone below it, (or indeed three Bones, for the Bone which we call the Shank or Shin, hath two ≈ømall Bones fa≈øtned to it running by its ≈øides down almo≈øt all its length till within two or three inches of the great Pa≈øtern; I ≈øay that as the Knee is that part which is the Wri≈øt in Man, ≈øo is this part between the Knee and great Pa≈øtern) an≈øwerable to the <hi>Metacarpium,</hi> that is, to that ≈øpace which reaches from the Wri≈øt to the ≈øetting on of the Fingers. Onely in Man there are five Bones, and in an Hor≈øe but three. So likewi≈øe does the great Pa≈øtern corre≈øpond to the fir≈øt Joint of the Finger; the little Pa≈øtern to the ≈øecond Joint; and the Coffin-joint on which the Hoof grows, to that Joint of the Finger on which the Nail grows.</p>
                        <p>By this you may ≈øee that the≈øe Parts of an Hor≈øe come very near the like Parts of a Man, the number of Bones and Mu≈øcles of the Fingers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted. For a Hor≈øe is <hi>≈øolidipes,</hi> or whole-footed, ≈øo that the whole of it is nece≈ø≈øarily moved at one time, and therefore has no need of that variety of Mu≈øcles that a Man's Hand is endowed withall. An Hor≈øe's Fore-feet are of no other u≈øe than to go upon, any more than his Hinder-feet; whereas the Hand of a Man is ordained for other u≈øes, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordingly ≈øhaped, and divided into more Parts, to wit four Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and a Thumb, all which have their peculiar Mu≈øcles to enable them to perform tho≈øe motions to which they are de≈øigned. Whence the number of the Mu≈øcles come to differ greatly. Now we ≈øhall take no notice of tho≈øe that a Man has more than an Hor≈øe, but ≈øhall onely treat of tho≈øe that are to be found to move the Joints of an Hor≈øe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cubit-bone, the Shank, the two Pa≈øterns, and the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin-joint.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt, the <hi>Cubit</hi> is either <hi>bended,</hi> or <hi>extended.</hi> Of the <hi>Benders</hi> there are two; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>Biceps,</hi> from its double beginning; for it hath two heads, the fir≈øt being outward, tendinous and round, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57416:129"/>from the upper brim of the hollowne≈øs of the Shoulder-blade; the ≈øecond head is broader, and is framed partly of a Tendon and partly of Fle≈øh: this ari≈øes from the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus Anchoriformis</hi> or Anchor-like Proce≈øs of the <hi>Scapula;</hi> then de≈øcending by the inner head of the Shoulder-bone, it meeteth with the former head, and becometh a ≈øtrong fle≈øhy Mu≈øcle, running down the in≈øide of the Cubit-bone to the Knee, where it is in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This bends the Cubit forwards and ≈øomewhat inwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Bender</hi> is from its ≈øituation in Humane Bodies (being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as the former is, upon the in≈øide of the Arm in them, and of the Leg in Hor≈øes; I ≈øay from its ≈øituation it is) called <hi>Brachiaeus Internus.</hi> This lies inwardly under the <hi>Biceps,</hi> and is ≈øomething ≈øhorter than it, but of a fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance like it. It takes its beginning near the end of that Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Shoulder called <hi>Deltoides,</hi> about the middle of the Shoulder-bone, to which it is firmly fa≈øtned: after which it runs its cour≈øe as the former, and is in≈øerted into the fore≈øide of the Cubit-bone a little above the Knee, a≈ø≈øi≈øting the motion of the former.</p>
                        <p>There are al≈øo two Mu≈øcles to <hi>extend</hi> the Cubit,which lie on its outer and hinder ≈øide. The fir≈øt of them from its length is called <hi>Longus.</hi> This ari≈øes with a ≈øtrong and broad original, partly nervous and partly fle≈øhy (which ≈øome make to be two heads) from the lower Rib of the Blade-bone, after which it de≈øcends on the hinder ≈øide of the Shoulder-bone, and al≈øo of the Cubit-bone, and is in≈øerted into its out≈øide ju≈øt at the Knee. This draws the Cubit backwards and ≈øomewhat outwards, and thereby extends it or ≈øtretches it out ≈øtreight.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Extender</hi> of the Cubit is called <hi>Brevis</hi> from its ≈øhortne≈øs.It ari≈øes from the hinder-part of the neck of the Shoulder-bone, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame cour≈øe as the former, is in≈øerted into the lower end of the Cubit-bone at the ≈øame place with the former, and a≈ø≈øi≈øts its motion.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe there are ≈øaid by ≈øome Anatomi≈øts to be two more <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> Mu≈øcles, <hi>viz.</hi> one called <hi>Brachiaeus Externus</hi> from its being placed on the <hi>out≈øide</hi> of the Arm in Men. But this is by <hi>Spigelius</hi> looked upon to be the ≈øecond head of the <hi>Long</hi> Mu≈øcle, becau≈øe it grows into one Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with it, and has the ≈øame in≈øertion with both it and the <hi>Short</hi> one.</p>
                        <p>The other is called <hi>Anconaeus,</hi> being a ≈ømall-bodied Mu≈øcle, ari≈øing from the lower and back-part of the Shoulder-bone, and is in≈øerted into the Cubit an inch or two below the Elbow. But ≈øome make this to be but a part of the <hi>Short</hi> Mu≈øcle.</p>
                        <p>As for the other Bone of this Joint in Men, called <hi>Radius, that</hi> al≈øo has its Mu≈øcles, which ≈øerve to turn the Arm and Hand round: But ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no ≈øuch Bone in an Hor≈øe, as neither any ≈øuch motion of an Hor≈øe's Leg, it cannot be expected there ≈øhould be found any Mu≈øcles in <hi>him</hi> an≈øwerable to the other, as to this part.</p>
                        <p>Pa≈øs we on therefore to the next Joint commonly called the Shank, but which truly an≈øwers to the Metacarp, or back of the hand in Men. And this like the Cubit is either <hi>bended</hi> or <hi>extended.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To <hi>bend</hi> it there are two Mu≈øcles; of which the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is called <hi>Cubitaeus internus.</hi> This ari≈øeth from the inner knob of the Shoulder-bone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending along the in≈øide of the Cubit, is implanted into the inner and hinder ≈øides of the top of the Shank.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Radiaeus internus</hi> in Men, though very improperly in an Hor≈øe, ≈øeeing he has no <hi>Radius.</hi> This has the ≈øame ri≈øe, progre≈øs and in≈øertion with the former.</p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:57416:130"/>
                        <p> There are al≈øo two Mu≈øcles to <hi>extend</hi> it; the fir≈øt of which is called <hi>Cubitaeus externus.</hi> This ≈øprings from the outer knob of the Shoulder-bone, and de≈øcending down the Cubit, is in≈øerted into the outer and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide of the head of the Shank.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the <hi>Extenders</hi> is called <hi>Radiaeus externus</hi> (improperly as to an Hor≈øe, as was noted before.) This has the ≈øame ri≈øe, progre≈øs and in≈øertion with its fellow.</p>
                        <p>The next Joint is the <hi>great Pa≈øtern</hi> which an≈øwers to the fir≈øt Joint of the Finger in a Man's Hand, as the <hi>little Pa≈øtern</hi> an≈øwers to the ≈øecond Joint, and the <hi>Coffin-joint</hi> to the la≈øt on which the Nail grows. All the≈øe are either bended or extended as the former Joints were. But before we de≈øcribe tho≈øe Mu≈øcles that perform the≈øe actions, there is one other to be treated of that is called in Man <hi>Palmaris,</hi> from its being ≈øpread over the Palm of the Hand; but in an Hor≈øe its Tendon is ≈øpread over the Sole of the Foot, whence the name of <hi>Plantaris</hi> would better agree to it. This ≈øprings fle≈øhy from the inner knob of the Shoulder-bone, but pre≈øently grows into a ≈ølender Tendon which de≈øcends to the Sole of the Foot as afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>Pa≈øterns</hi> and <hi>Coffin-joint</hi> are bended by two Mu≈øcles; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>Sublimis,</hi> (I ≈øuppo≈øe becau≈øe it ri≈øes <hi>high</hi> up.) It ≈øprings from the inner knob of the Shoulder-bone, and is in≈øerted into the Pa≈øterns.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is named <hi>Profundus.</hi> This ari≈øes from the upper part of the Cubit-bone, and is in≈øerted into the Coffin-joint.</p>
                        <p> They are extended by <hi>one</hi> very con≈øiderable Mu≈øcle, called <hi>Exten≈øor magnus.</hi> This ≈øprings from the outer knob of the Shoulder-bone, and its Tendon is in≈øerted into the fore and outer ≈øide of the Pa≈øterns and Coffin-joint. Some reckon this to be two Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>There are ≈øeveral other proper Mu≈øcles that belong to the Fingers in Men, ≈øome to one and ≈øome to another, as al≈øo others that move them laterally, or to and from one another, which it were from our purpo≈øe here to mention, as not being to be found in an Hor≈øe. Though I dare not affirm po≈øitively that there are no more than I have here de≈øcribed; for I am apt to ≈øu≈øpect the contrary from the multitude of Tendons that de≈øcend into the Coffin-joint: however the≈øe that I have mention'd are the mo≈øt con≈øiderable and plainly di≈øcoverable; and rather than encrea≈øe their number at a <hi>venture,</hi> I will be content that this Chapter be reputed imperfect.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the Mu≈øcles of the Thigh.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>1. The Benders of the Thigh are three. P≈øoas. 2. Iliacus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus. 3. Pectineus. 1. The Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are al≈øo three. Glutaeus major. 2. Glutaeus medius. 3. Glutaeus minor. One Mover of the Thigh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, viz. Triceps or Quadriceps. Four Mu≈øcles move the Thigh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, called Quadrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. Al≈øo the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides of the Thigh. 1 The Thigh is turned a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about by two Mu≈øcles. viz. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus. 2. Obturator externus.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BY the <hi>Thigh</hi> we mean that part which is betwixt the Joint of the <hi>Huckle</hi> or <hi>Whirle</hi>-bone, and that which is called the <hi>Stifle;</hi> which con≈øi≈øteth of one large and long Bone, going by the name of the Thigh-bone, or <hi>Femur.</hi> This Bone hath a round head which is jointed into the round Cavity of the Hip-bone, ≈øo that it admits of all kinds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whence it hath a multitude of Mu≈øcles to perform the≈øe motions; ≈øome of which move the Thigh forwards, whereby it is bended; ≈øome move it backwards, and thereby extend it: a third ≈øort bend it inward, as when a Hor≈øe rubs the contrary Leg with his Foot, which is often ≈øeen upon any itching or pricking humour affecting that Part: a fourth ≈øort move it outwards; and a fifth obliquely about. But fir≈øt of the <hi>Benders forwards,</hi> which are accounted to be three in number.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>P≈øoas</hi> or <hi>Lumbaris.</hi> This is almo≈øt round,thick and livid, and lieth in the inner part of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> upon the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> of the Loins. It ari≈øes fle≈øhy from the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of the two lowe≈øt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Che≈øt and two or three uppermo≈øt of the Loins; from whence de≈øcending by the in≈øide of <hi>Os ileum,</hi> at length it ends in a ≈øtrong and round Tendon, which is in≈øerted on the fore≈øide of the upper part of the le≈ø≈øer head of the Thigh-bone. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this is, ≈øtrongly to draw the Thigh upward, and ≈øomewhat inward. Upon this Mu≈øcle the Kidneys are placed, near that part of it where its Nerve enters into it; which in Men is the cau≈øe of that ≈øtupor or numbne≈øs that is felt in the Thigh by tho≈øe that are troubled with the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, on that ≈øide that the Stone is on.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Bender forward</hi> is called <hi>Iliacus internus,</hi> or the inward Haunch Mu≈øcle. It ≈øpringeth with a ≈ølender and fle≈øhy beginning from the in≈øide of the Haunch-bone, and being joined by its Tendon to the former Mu≈øcle, is in≈øerted with a round Tendon into the le≈ø≈øer head or <hi>Rotator</hi> of the Thigh-bone. The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this is the ≈øame with the fir≈øt, which is, to lift the Thigh up and ≈øo to bend it forward; yet it doth not move it ≈øo much inward as the <hi>P≈øoas</hi> doth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is called <hi>Pectineus,</hi> ari≈øing broad and fle≈øhy from the line of the Share-bone near its Gri≈øtle, and is implanted into the in≈øide of the lower end of the Thigh-bone with a broad and large Tendon. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to draw the Thigh upward and inward. This is the Mu≈øcle that in Men helps to lay one Thigh over the other in ≈øitting.</p>
                        <p>Note, that both this la≈øt foregoing, and all the following Mu≈øcles ≈øave the two la≈øt, are in≈øerted at the lower end of the Thigh-bone, ju≈øt above the Stifle; whereas in Men they are mo≈øt of them if not all in≈øerted into its upper part, <hi>viz.</hi> either into its neck, or into one or other of the two knobs jetting out at the lower end of the neck, (called the great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trochanters.) What may be the rea≈øon of this different in≈øertion is not ea≈øie to gue≈øs, unle≈øs it be the ≈øhortne≈øs of the Thigh-bone, which in an Hor≈øe is not half ≈øo long as it is in a tall Man: ≈øo that an Hor≈øe's Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57416:132"/>being ≈øo plump and bulky upon his Buttocks, it was nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould have ≈øome con≈øiderable ≈øpace to grow ≈ølenderer in and to become tendinous; and therefore they are extended as far as the <hi>Stifle</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers to the <hi>Knee</hi> in Man.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the Mu≈øcles that bend <hi>back</hi> and ≈øo <hi>extend</hi> the Thigh,(as when an Hor≈øe ≈øtretches him≈øelf) which motion is al≈øo performed by three Mu≈øcles. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>Glutaeus externus,</hi> or the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardmo≈øt Buttock Mu≈øcle; in Men it is al≈øo called <hi>Glutaeus major,</hi> the greate≈øt Buttock Mu≈øcle; but in an Hor≈øe it is not ≈øo, for in them the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemo≈øt is the large≈øt. This ≈øpringeth with a very fle≈øhy beginning from the Crupper, from the Spine or ridge of the Haunch-bone, and from the <hi>Os ≈øacrum.</hi> Afterward de≈øcending a little obliquely and riding over the Joint of the Huckle-bone, it at length grows narrower and more ≈ølender, and ≈øo endeth into a ≈øtrong and broad Tendon, which is in≈øerted into the inner part of the Thigh-bone ju≈øt above the Stifle, yea it ≈øeems to reach as far as to the top of the <hi>Tibia.</hi> Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to draw the Thigh backward and ≈øo to extend it, as al≈øo to enable the Hor≈øe to go backward.</p>
                        <p>The next or <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Glutaeus medius,</hi> or the middle Buttock Mu≈øcle. This in Man (becau≈øe of his going erect) lieth quite under the former, and is ≈øo hid by it, that unle≈øs the former be fir≈øt removed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øeen. But in Hor≈øes it is larger than the former, and lieth ≈øide by ≈øide with it, as doth the next al≈øo, and they are both to be ≈øeen without removing the fir≈øt, as may be plainly ob≈øerved by the following Figure. It ari≈øes with a fle≈øhy and broad beginning, a little higher than the fir≈øt, from the Spine of the Haunch-bone on the fore-part of it, and from thence de≈øcends ≈øomewhat obliquely over the Joint of the Hip as far as to the lower end of the Thigh-bone, into the outer ≈øide of which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted with a broad, ≈øtrong and membranous Tendon. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Thigh and to draw it outward and backward, as when the Hor≈øe ≈øtands to ≈øtale.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> and la≈øt of the <hi>Extenders</hi> is called <hi>Glutaeus minor,</hi> or le≈ø≈øer Buttock Mu≈øcle. This in a Hor≈øe ari≈øes equal in height with the former at the Spine of the Haunch-bone. At its beginning it is round, ≈øharp and fle≈øhy; but in its cour≈øe it becomes more broad, de≈øcending with an oblique line by the ≈øide of the ≈øecond Mu≈øcle, and is in≈øerted at the lower end of the Thigh-bone, rather towards its fore-≈øide. This a≈ø≈øi≈øts the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, drawing the Thigh outward and backward.</p>
                        <p>The Thigh is drawn to the <hi>in≈øide</hi> by the Mu≈øcle <hi>Triceps,</hi> or <hi>Quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi> for it goes by both names, becau≈øe ≈øome affirm it to have four, and others but three beginnings. This Mu≈øcle is looked upon to be the thicke≈øt of all the Mu≈øcles of the whole Body, being furni≈øhed with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fibres.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt of its beginnings is from the upper part of the Share-bone, where it ari≈øes with a nervous head, and de≈øcending is in≈øerted into the in≈øide of the lower end of the Thigh-bone.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond part of it ari≈øes from the lower ≈øide of the ≈øame Bone, being fle≈øhy and broad, and is in≈øerted into the in≈øide of the Thigh-bone, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher up than the former.</p>
                        <p>The third head of this Mu≈øcle ari≈øes with a fle≈øhy and ≈øometimes ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous beginning from the whole lower part of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> round about the circumference of its wide hole; and is in≈øerted near the la≈øt.</p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57416:132"/>
                        <p>The fourth head ≈øprings with a nervous and fle≈øhy beginning from the tip of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> and afterward running along the in≈øide of the Thigh, endeth into a round Tendon, which joining with the Tendon of the fir≈øt part of this Mu≈øcle is in≈øerted into the lower end of the Thigh-bone with it.</p>
                        <p>The Thigh is al≈øo turned <hi>outward,</hi> which motion is performed by four ≈ømall Mu≈øcles called <hi>Quadrigemini,</hi> all which are placed one by another upon the out≈øide of the articulation of the Thigh. The fir≈øt of them is from its ≈øituation called <hi>Iliacus externus,</hi> and from its figure, <hi>Pyriformis</hi> or Pear-like Mu≈øcle. This is longer than any of the re≈øt of them, ari≈øing round from the lower and outer part of <hi>Os ≈øacrum;</hi> thence it runneth downward upon the back≈øide of the great <hi>Rotator,</hi> and is implanted into the out≈øide of the lower end of the Thigh-bone.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond and third of the≈øe Mu≈øcles do want particular names; but both of them ari≈øe from the knob of <hi>Os i≈øchium,</hi> near one another, and are in≈øerted with the fir≈øt.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and la≈øt is called <hi>Quadrigeminus quadratus.</hi> It is more fle≈øhy and broad than the re≈øt, ari≈øing from the inner part of the knob of the <hi>I≈øchium,</hi> lying ≈øome two or three inches di≈øtant from the third, and endeth with the former.</p>
                        <p>To the≈øe mu≈øt be added that Mu≈øcle which we have named the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides</hi> of the Thigh, not finding any in Humane Bodies to an≈øwer to it,≈øo as to borrow a name from thence. It ≈øprings (as you may ≈øee plain in the foregoing Figure) from the out≈øide of the tip of the <hi>Ileum,</hi> with a ≈øharp beginning; but pre≈øently enlarging it ≈øelf, becomes three-≈øquare, and is in≈øerted with a broad membranous Tendon into the out≈øide of the Thigh-bone, from which in≈øertion it appears torn off in the Figure. By its ≈øituation it ≈øeems to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the action of the <hi>Quadrigemini.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Thigh is turned about obliquely by two Mu≈øcles called <hi>Obturato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>or Stoppers, becau≈øe they fill up the wide hole between the <hi>Os pubis</hi> and Hip-bone. The fir≈øt is called <hi>Obturator internus.</hi> This ari≈øeth from the inner circumference of the hole before ≈øpoken of, and pa≈ø≈øing over-thwart the end of the Hip-bone, is in≈øerted into the Cavity of the great <hi>Rotator.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other is called <hi>Obturator externus,</hi> the outward Filler. This ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes out of the external circumference of the above-named hole with a fle≈øhy and broad beginning, and winding about the neck of the Thigh-bone turneth into a ≈øtrong and large Tendon which is implanted into the Cavity of the great <hi>Rotator</hi> with the former.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Thigh,</hi> which for order ≈øake I have according to the cu≈øtom of Anatomi≈øts fir≈øt treated of; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary that we make our di≈ø≈øection in the Leg fir≈øt, to remove tho≈øe Mu≈øcles; for we cannot ≈øo ea≈øily nor conveniently rai≈øe nor ≈øhew the≈øe of the Thigh, untill tho≈øe of the Leg be removed, becau≈øe the heads of ≈øome of them lie upon the Mu≈øcles of the Thigh.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Tibia</hi> or Leg are of the ≈øame number in Hor≈øes as in Men, (like as the Mu≈øcles of mo≈øt other Parts are) the in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øome of them onely excepted. Which difference ≈øprings from hence, that this Bone of the Leg which in a Hor≈øe is but one main Bone ≈øupported on each ≈øide with another ≈ølender immoveable one for ≈øtrength, as al≈øo for the ≈øafer pa≈ø≈øage of the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles between them, (which I ≈øuppo≈øe to be the onely u≈øe of them, as not being moveable; I ≈øay this Bone which in a Hor≈øe is but one) is in a Man two, going by two different names, <hi>viz.</hi> the one by that of <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the other, by that of <hi>Fibula,</hi> and ≈øome of the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles are in≈øerted into one of them, and ≈øome into the other. But otherwi≈øe ≈øo far as I have had opportunity to examine them, I have found them to have the ≈øame original, ≈øub≈øtance, figure and cour≈øe in a Hor≈øe as in Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ≈øhall proceed to treat of them after the ≈øame method as I have done of all the re≈øt, forbearing to ≈øpeak any further of the difference (in a Man and an Hor≈øe) between the Parts that are moved by the Mu≈øcles to be treated of in this and the following Chapter, untill I come to the Book of the Bones, where I ≈øhall ≈øhew at large the ≈øimilitude between them, and that the difference is not ≈øo much as it may be believed to be.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Leg</hi> hath three motions allowed it, <hi>viz.</hi> bended, extended, and moved obliquely outwards. All the <hi>Extenders</hi> are placed on the fore-part of the Thigh, of which the fir≈øt is called <hi>Membrano≈øus.</hi> This Mu≈øcle is by <hi>Bartholin</hi> called the <hi>Abductor,</hi> as if its u≈øe were to move the Leg oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outwards; but that office is by other Anatomi≈øts ≈øince him a≈øcribed to the <hi>Poplitaeus,</hi> and this ≈øaid to extend the Leg. It ari≈øeth fle≈øhy from the upper part of <hi>Os ileum</hi> on the out≈øide, and near the great Proce≈øs of the Thigh-bone it becomes broad and nervou≈øly membranous, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>Fa≈øcia lata,</hi> the broad Swadling-band, for it enwrappeth almo≈øt all the Mu≈øcles of the Thigh within it ≈øelf; and being come as low as the Knee in Humane Bodies, and that Joint we call the Stifle in Hor≈øes, (which exactly an≈øwers to the other, even as far as to the little round Bone between the two Bones of the <hi>Femur</hi> and <hi>Tibia,</hi> called the <hi>Patella</hi> or Knee-pan) I ≈øay when it is come as low as the Stifle (over which it cro≈ø≈øes) it is at la≈øt in≈øerted into the <hi>fore-≈øide</hi> of the <hi>Tibia</hi> or Bone of the Leg. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is, as hath been ≈øaid, to extend the Leg direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or as ≈øome Authours will have it, ≈øomewhat to abduce it or draw it obliquely outwards.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Extender</hi> is called <hi>Longus,</hi> and <hi>Sartorius</hi> or <hi>Sutorius,</hi> from its u≈øe in tho≈øe Men that ≈øit cro≈øs-legg'd at work, as <hi>Shoomakers</hi> and <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</hi> It ari≈øes ≈øharp and nervous from the upper and fore-part of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of <hi>Os ileum,</hi> and as it pa≈ø≈øes obliquely down the in≈øide of the Thigh, it becomes more fle≈øhy and broad, continuing ≈øo till it come to the in≈øide of the Leg a little below the Stifle, where it ends in a broad Tendon, and is in≈øerted into the Bone of the Leg or <hi>Tibia.</hi> The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57416:133"/>Mu≈øcle is not onely to extend the Leg, but al≈øo to draw it inwards, wherefore it is by ≈øome Authours reckoned for one of the <hi>Benders</hi> of the Leg.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third,</hi> from its <hi>≈øtreight</hi> cour≈øe, is called <hi>Rectus,</hi> the Streight Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. This takes its beginning from the lower brim of the Haunch-bone, and pa≈ø≈øing with a fle≈øhy and round belly ≈øtreight down the fore-≈øide of the Thigh untill it come to the Stifle, it there turns into a ≈øtrong and broad Tendon, which adhering to the <hi>Patella</hi> de≈øcends over it, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the fore-≈øide of the upper part of the Shank.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Va≈øtus externus,</hi> becau≈øe of its <hi>great</hi> fle≈øhy <hi>bulk,</hi>and becau≈øe it de≈øcends on the <hi>out≈øide</hi> of the Streight Mu≈øcle. It ari≈øes broad and nervous from the root of the great <hi>Rotator</hi> or <hi>Trochanter,</hi> cleaving clo≈øe to the outward part of the Thigh-bone all along its cour≈øe, untill it come to the Stifle, where it becomes membranous and broad, and uniting with the Tendon of the Streight Mu≈øcle or <hi>Rectus,</hi> is in≈øerted into the ≈øame place with it, but on its out≈øide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> is called <hi>Va≈øtus internus,</hi> running on the <hi>in≈øide</hi> of the <hi>Rectus.</hi>It ari≈øes from the root of the le≈ø≈øer <hi>Trochanter</hi> and from the neck of the Thigh-bone with a nervous beginning, and afterwards growing fle≈øhy de≈øcends down the Thigh-bone, ≈øticking clo≈øe to it, till it come to the Stifle, over which it pa≈ø≈øeth, and afterward unites its ≈øelf with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two, and takes its in≈øertion in the ≈øame place of the <hi>Tibia</hi> as they do.</p>
                        <p>It is worth the Di≈ø≈øectour's taking notice of the≈øe three la≈øt Mu≈øcles, how they be joined all in one ju≈øt at their cro≈ø≈øing the Stifle, where they make one broad and very ≈øtrong Tendon, which ≈øpreads over and involves the <hi>Patella</hi> or little Bone of the Stifle, and ties it ≈øo fa≈øt in its place upon the jointing of the Thigh-bone with the <hi>Tibia,</hi> that it is very ≈øeldom di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, or indeed never. For although by di≈øtentions or ≈øtrains we often have this Part affected; yet never did I ≈øee an ab≈øolute di≈ølocation in it. The <hi>Patella</hi> indeed may be (and often is) wrenched either to one ≈øide or the other as the accident may happen, but it is immediately reduced to its place again by this compound ligamentous Tendon, which like a <hi>Spring</hi> retracts it ≈øelf into its former Station, and the Bone to which it is knit, al≈øo. So that, that malady which is commonly taken for a di≈ølo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Bone, ≈øeems rather to be from Bloud extrava≈øated out of the Capillary Ve≈ø≈øels, which by great di≈øtentions many times may be broken; which Bloud lieth congealing and putrifying in the ≈øpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Membranes and Mu≈øcles, affecting the ≈øen≈øible neighbouring Parts, which puts the Hor≈øe to that great pain we ob≈øerve him to have on ≈øuch accidents. Now the means we u≈øe to remove this pain is by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing the Part with penetrating Oils, which commonly effect the cure, if they be u≈øed pre≈øently before the Bloud be too much congealed: But if the pain be not removed by this means, we are fain to open the Skin by way of an I≈ø≈øue, blowing in wind to ≈øeparate the ≈øeveral Skins one from another, and ≈øo make way for the congealed Matter the better to come forth; which done, the pain is removed, and the affection quite taken away, and the Hor≈øe mo≈øt times goes again as well as ever. Whereas ≈øhould this Bone be di≈øplac'd, as it is by many Farriers thought to be, this way of proceeding ≈øeems ≈øo far from contributing to the cure, that by laying the Skins open there is rather given more liberty for the Bone to remove out of its place, than any a≈ø≈øi≈øtance afforded toward the re≈øtoring it again. But
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57416:134"/>≈øo much by way of digre≈ø≈øion to inform our Profe≈ø≈øours in this point; I ≈øhall now proceed to de≈øcribe the remaining Mu≈øcles, the next of which are the <hi>Benders</hi> of the Leg.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe are in number four; the fir≈øt of which (according to <hi>Bartholin</hi>) is called <hi>Biceps,</hi> though by other Authours it is reckoned the la≈øt and fifth, ≈øuppo≈øing that there are five of the≈øe Mu≈øcles. It ari≈øes ≈øharp and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous from the appendix of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> and being carried on the out≈øide of the Thigh, it doth about its middle become fle≈øhy, as if it begun there with a ≈øecond head; from whence de≈øcending it groweth in its cour≈øe more thick and outwardly nervous, untill it becomes a ≈øtrong Tendon, which is in≈øerted into the outer ≈øide, (but ≈øomewhat backward) of the appendix of the <hi>Tibia.</hi> The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Mu≈øcle is to bend the Leg by pulling it backward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>next,</hi> according to the before-named <hi>Bartholin,</hi> is the <hi>Semimem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brano≈øus,</hi> which by others is reputed the fourth Bender. It takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the knob of the <hi>Coxendix</hi> as the former doth, with a ≈ømall, membranous head, from whence it runneth down the back-part of the Thigh, till it come to the Leg-bone, into which it is in≈øerted with a round Tendon behind, in that place which in Man is called the Ham.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> (according to the ≈øame Authour) is the <hi>Seminervo≈øus,</hi> ≈øo called from its ≈øub≈øtance, it being partly nervous and partly fle≈øhy, as the former was partly fle≈øhy and partly membranous. This ari≈øes ≈ømall and nervous from the ≈øame knob of the <hi>Coxendix</hi> as the former two did; from whence de≈øcending obliquely by the back and inner part of the Thigh (in which cour≈øe it becomes fle≈øhy) its Tendon reaches towards the middle of the Leg-bone, into who≈øe inner and backer part it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Gracilis,</hi> the ≈ølender Mu≈øcle. This by ≈øome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours is accounted for the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Bender of the Leg, but I ≈øhall after the method of the before-named Authour rank it for the fourth and la≈øt. It ari≈øes with a large and nervous beginning from the middle of the Share-bone ju≈øt at its jointing, from whence it runs down the in≈øide of the Thigh untill it comes to the <hi>Tibia</hi> or Leg-bone, into who≈øe in≈øide it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted with a round Tendon near the former.</p>
                        <p>Note, that ≈øome of the≈øe Mu≈øcles being placed more outward and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more inward; if they all work together, they draw the Leg direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backward; but if one be contracted alone, then it doth bend the Leg a little either to this or that ≈øide, according as the Mu≈øcle is placed, as well as draw it backward.</p>
                        <p>There is another Mu≈øcle who≈øe u≈øe is to move the Leg <hi>obliquely;</hi> its name is <hi>Poplitaeus.</hi> It takes its ri≈øe broad and nervous from the outer head of the Thigh-bone, and afterward becoming fle≈øhy runs with a ≈ølan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting line down the Thigh to the back and inward part of the upper knob of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> where it is in≈øerted.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The In≈øtep-bone is ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two Mu≈øcles. 1. Tibiaeus anticus. 2. Peronaeus anticus. It is extended by three. 1. Ga≈øtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cnemius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus. 2. Ga≈øtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cnemius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus. 3. Plantaris. The Tendons of the≈øe three Mu≈øcles make the magna Chorda. 1. It is moved ≈øideways by two. Tibialis po≈øticus. 2. Peronaeus po≈øticus. 1. The Pa≈øterns and Coffin-joint are ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two Mu≈øcles. Flexor longus. 2. Flexor brevis. 1. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended al≈øo by two. Exten≈øor longus. 2. Exten≈øor brevis.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BY the <hi>lower part</hi> of the Leg is to be under≈øtood that Bone which is below the Hock or Hough, reaching from thence to the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtern; which Bone an≈øwers to tho≈øe five in Humane Bodies that make the In≈øtep. Likewi≈øe the great Pa≈øtern and little Pa≈øtern an≈øwer to the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Joints of the Toes in Men; and la≈øtly that which is called the Coffin-joint on which the Hoof grows, is an≈øwerable to the la≈øt joint of the Toes on which the Nails are placed. Onely the difference is, that a Man becau≈øe of his going upright, treadeth upon the whole ≈øpace from the Heel to the Toes; and his Foot is al≈øo divided into five Toes, each con≈øi≈øting of ≈øeveral Joints, that by ≈øpreading them≈øelves and gra≈øping clo≈øely on what he treads upon, they may keep him the more firmly erect. Whereas a Hor≈øe and other four-footed Bea≈øts having four Feet upon the ground, have no need of ≈øo broad nor large a Foot, and do therefore go as it were upon Tip-toes, their Heels reaching as high up the Leg as to the Hock, which indeed is the Heel of the Hor≈øe, as a very eminent and learned Phy≈øician who did me the honour to take a view of my Skeleton, intimated to me. For make but any Quadruped, as a Dog or the like, ≈øtand upright, lifting up his Fore-feet, and you may ob≈øerve all that part of his <hi>Leg</hi> from the Hough downwards to lie upon the ground as a Man's Foot does; yea ≈øome, as Coneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their ordinary gate tread upon all that ≈øpace: onely ≈øuch Creatures have their Feet cleft into Toes, whereas a Hor≈øe is whole-footed, and thence ari≈øes a difference as to the number of the Mu≈øcles of the Foot.</p>
                        <p>Note, that the Mu≈øcles which move each Bone have onely their <hi>In≈øertions</hi> into that Bone they are to move, and that they take their <hi>ri≈øe</hi> from the Bone or ≈øome other Part (immediately or mediately) above it, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved by the foregoing di≈øcour≈øe of the Mu≈øcles of the Thigh and Leg. Thus tho≈øe Mu≈øcles that move the Thigh, take their original from either the Hip-bone, Share-bone, or <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> all of which are above it; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe tho≈øe that move the Leg, ari≈øe from the Hip or Share-bones, or el≈øe from the Head or ≈øome other part of the Thigh-bone which is the Joint above it; and thus la≈øtly do the Mu≈øcles that are to move all that part of the Leg or Foot which is below the Hock, ≈øpring from and lie upon the Parts above the Hock, ≈øave the <hi>Flexor brevis</hi> and <hi>Ten≈øor brevis,</hi> and the <hi>Plantaris</hi> which is at the Sole of the Foot (which cannot properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Mu≈øcle neither, for it is very little or not at all carnous, but rather ligamentous) for otherwi≈øe onely the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles reach hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are in≈øerted ≈øome into one Joint, ≈øome into another.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Foot</hi> is bended, extended, and moved (a little) to either ≈øide,ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motion of the <hi>In≈øtep-bone</hi> (for ≈øo we ≈øhall call it for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctions ≈øake.) Fir≈øt, it is <hi>bended</hi> when it is drawn upwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To perform which motion there are two Mu≈øcles a≈ø≈øi≈øting: the fir≈øt of which is called <hi>Tibiaeus anticus</hi> or the forward Leg-mu≈øcle, ≈øo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57416:135"/>named from the ≈øituation of it, which is upon the fore-part of the Leg-bone towards its outer ≈øide. It ari≈øes ≈øharp and fle≈øhy from the upper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of the Leg-bone, cleaving clo≈øe to it all along as it de≈øcends, and towards the bottom of it, it turneth by degrees to a Tendon, which pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing under the Gri≈øtle that compa≈ø≈øeth about the next Joint or Hock, is divided into two or more Tendons that are in≈øerted into the fore≈øide of the In≈øtep-bone, which (together with the re≈øt of the Foot) it moves forward and upward.</p>
                        <p>The next is called <hi>Peronaeus anticus,</hi> becau≈øe it ari≈øes in Man from that Bone of the Leg that is called <hi>Perone</hi> or <hi>Fibula,</hi> and therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ≈øo called in an Hor≈øe that wants that Bone, and in whom it ≈øprings from the upper appendix of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and de≈øcending downwards with a fle≈øhy body till it come almo≈øt to the bottom of this Bone, it turneth into a Tendon as the former did, which Tendon pa≈ø≈øeth down by the out≈øide of the Hock, and is in≈øerted into the out≈øide of the In≈øtep-bone, which with the re≈øt of the Foot it moves forward and ≈øomewhat outward.</p>
                        <p>The Foot is al≈øo <hi>Extended,</hi> that is, when the In≈øtep-bone is drawn backwards, which motion is performed by three Mu≈øcles: of which the fir≈øt is called <hi>Gemellus externus,</hi> or <hi>Ga≈øtrocnemius externus.</hi> This in Men makes the greate≈øt part of the Calf of the Leg. It takes its ri≈øe broad and fle≈øhy from the inner head of the Thigh-bone at the lower end of it, and al≈øo from the outward head of the ≈øame Bone, for it hath a double be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; which two heads de≈øcending for a while apart, they begin to be united into one about the middle of the Leg-bone, after which they both turn into one entire, broad, ≈øtrong and nervous Tendon, which unites with the Tendon of the following Mu≈øcle called <hi>Ga≈øtrocnemius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus,</hi> and both are in≈øerted into the Heel-bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Extender</hi> of the Foot is called <hi>Ga≈øtrocnemius internus.</hi> This Mu≈øcle lyeth ≈øomething under the former, ari≈øing from the hinder-part of the upper end of the Leg-bone with a ≈øtrong, nervous beginning, and growing tendinous toward the lower end of the Bone unites with the Tendon of the foregoing, and is in≈øerted into the Heel-bone with it as afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> and la≈øt is called <hi>Plantaris,</hi> or the Mu≈øcle of the Soal or Tread. This ari≈øes fle≈øhy, round and ≈ølender between the former two, taking its beginning from the back-part of the lower head of the Thigh-bone. After it hath de≈øcended a little way down the Leg-bone it becomes a ≈ølender round Tendon, which running between the Tendons of the former two and joining very clo≈øely with them de≈øcends down to the Heel-bone, where it leaves them and proceeds along the back-part of the In≈øtep-bone and the two Pa≈øterns, and terminates within the Foot, ≈øpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all about the bottom of it, making that Part which is called the Soal of the Foot in Men, and in Hor≈øes that Part that lieth next under the Soal, and is plain to be ≈øeen when we have drawn the Soal of the Foot out.</p>
                        <p>It is the Tendons of the≈øe three Mu≈øcles that make that ≈øtrong and thick Tendon by which Butchers hang up their Meat,which by rea≈øon of its greatne≈øs and ≈øingular ≈øtrength is called <hi>Chorda magna.</hi> It is al≈øo this Tendon running down the back-part of the Leg, which we call the back Sinew, which being affected either by a ≈øtrain or brui≈øe or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, cau≈øes ≈øo great a pain, by rea≈øon of the ≈øen≈øiblene≈øs of the Tendon. When it is hurt, the Hor≈øe many times falls exceeding lame, though ≈øuch
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57416:136"/>accidents are not ≈øo dangerous to life in Hor≈øes as they are ≈øaid to be in Men; for we make no difficulty in curing them, e≈øpecially if pre≈øently taken in hand, but Chirurgeons do mo≈øt times conclude Wounds of this Part in Men to be very dangerous by rea≈øon of their frequent falling into convul≈øions thereupon.</p>
                        <p> The Foot is al≈øo moved ≈øomewhat ≈øideways, <hi>viz.</hi> inward and outward,by two Mu≈øcles. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>Tibialis po≈øticus.</hi> This ≈øpringeth from the upper end of the Leg-bone, from whence it de≈øcends among the before-named hinder Mu≈øcles till it come to the In≈øtep-joint, where it becomes tendinous, and from thence runs down the inner ≈øide of the In≈øtep-bone and Pa≈øterns, till it come to the Soal of the Foot, into which it is in≈øerted. Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to move the Foot obliquely inward.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Peronaeus po≈øticus</hi> (improperly in an Hor≈øe.) It ari≈øes from the upper and hinder-part of the Leg-bone by a nervous and ≈øtrong beginning, from whence it de≈øcends all along the out≈øide of the Bone cleaving firmly to it, untill it reach its middle, where it becomes tendinous, and de≈øcends with the Tendon of the <hi>Peronaeus anticus</hi> on the out≈øide of the In≈øtep-joint or Hock, but is not joined with it; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues its cour≈øe further untill it reach the Foot, into the bottom of which it is implanted. This moves the Foot contrary to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> obliquely outward.</p>
                        <p> The Pa≈øterns and Coffin-joint are likewi≈øe <hi>bended,</hi> or <hi>extended</hi> by their proper Mu≈øcles. The <hi>Benders</hi> are two, of which the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is called <hi>Flexor longus,</hi> or the Long Bender. This ari≈øes from the upper and hinder-part of the Leg-bone, about the middle whereof it becometh tendinous, and de≈øcends on the inner ≈øide of the Hough down the In≈øtep-bone and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterns into the Coffin-joint.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Flexor brevis,</hi> the Short Bender. It ≈øprings from the in≈øide of the Heel-bone a little below the Hock, and has the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion with the former. The≈øe bend the Pa≈øterns and Coffin-joint by drawing them backward.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>Extenders</hi> are al≈øo two. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is called <hi>Longus Ten≈øor,</hi> or the Long Extender. It ari≈øes from the fore and inner ≈øide of the Shank ju≈øt under the Stifle, and de≈øcends on the fore-≈øide of that Bone, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtep-bone and the Pa≈øterns, and is in≈øerted into the fore and upper part of the Coffin-joint.</p>
                        <p> The <hi>≈øecond</hi> ari≈øeth from the fore-part of the annular Ligament that binds about the In≈øtep-joint, and de≈øcending under the former has the ≈øame in≈øertion. The≈øe two extend the Pa≈øterns and Coffin-joint by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them forward.</p>
                        <p>Thus I am come to the end of the Treati≈øe of the Mu≈øcles, in de≈øcribing of any of which if I have erred, I hope the Apology with which I prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this fourth Book will obtain my excu≈øe with all ingenuous Men: and as for the moro≈øe and carping, I ≈øhall take it as a favour from them, if in≈øtead of railing at random, they will take the pains to demon≈øtrate my mi≈øtakes.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the nature, definition, differences and parts of Bones.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The definition of a Bone. The material and efficient cau≈øes of a Bone. Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Their Parts. How many Bones of the Head.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Bones</hi> are by a learned and ancient Philo≈øopher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Carka≈øe of a Ship, to which the re≈øt of the Parts are fa≈øtned and whereupon they are ≈øu≈øtained. The≈øe afford ≈øtability, ≈øtreightne≈øs and form to each Part and to the whole. The knowledge of them is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary; for without it we mu≈øt needs be ignorant of the originals and in≈øertions of the Mu≈øcles; and upon fractures or di≈ølocations of them, it were very unlikely that any ≈øhould ≈øet them right again without the knowledge of their ≈øhapes, and the manner of their jointing one with another.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Bone</hi> is ≈øaid to be a <hi>≈øimilar Part, the drie≈øt and colde≈øt of all the re≈øt, made of the mo≈øt earthy and tartareous part of the Seed in the Womb,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of the Humour in the <hi>Ovum</hi> or Conception) and is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed with the like particles of Bloud after the birth, and moi≈øtned with the Marrow contained in it.</p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:57416:138"/>
                        <p>In which de≈øcription the word <hi>[Seed]</hi> is to be interpreted as we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,and not of the Male and Female's Seed mixed together in the Womb, as the Ancients conceived; for it is certain that the Female hath no true Seed, and that the Male's being onely an active principle of generation, affords nothing of matter to the Parts of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> but onely impregnates the <hi>Ovum,</hi> as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed more at large when I come to ≈øpeak to the <hi>Generation of Animals.</hi> Thus the Male's Seed is no material cau≈øe at all of the Bones, but onely a <hi>remote</hi> efficient cau≈øe of them as it is of other Parts of the Body; of all which the pla≈øtick or formative power that is ≈øeated in the <hi>Ovum</hi> it ≈øelf, is the <hi>immediate</hi> efficient.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>differences</hi> of Bones, they are many, as being divided or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øhed ≈øeveral ways. And fir≈øt from their hardne≈øs, or ≈øoftne≈øs: thus the lower parts of the Temple-bones are called <hi>Petro≈øa,</hi> ≈øtony Bones, and ≈øuch are al≈øo the Bones of the Teeth. Others are in re≈øpect to the≈øe, ≈øoft; ≈øuch are the ≈øpongy Bones of the No≈øe, and tho≈øe which are called <hi>appendices</hi> to any Bone. And la≈øtly of a mean ≈øub≈øtance between the≈øe may be reckoned all the re≈øt of the Bones.</p>
                        <p>They are again divided or di≈øtingui≈øhed by their magnitude; thus ≈øome are e≈øteemed great, ≈øome little, and ≈øome of a moderate ≈øize betwixt both.</p>
                        <p>Al≈øo they are divided by their figure; ≈øome being plain, ≈øome round; ≈øome have three ≈øides, others four; ≈øome are like a Boat, ≈øome a Cup; ≈øome like a Hammer, an Anvil, or a Stirrop, ≈øuch are the Auditory Bones.</p>
                        <p>They are al≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed from their ≈øituation, connexion, cavity, ≈øen≈øe, and upon ≈øeveral other con≈øiderations, which it would be tedious further to pro≈øecute.</p>
                        <p>Again, the Bones are many of them divided into three <hi>parts;</hi> fir≈øt, that part whereof the body of the Bone con≈øi≈øteth; ≈øecondly, the part that groweth to the Bone; thirdly, the bunching part of the Bone: of which the fir≈øt hath no proper name belonging to it, but is called by the name of the whole Bone; the ≈øecond being that part that groweth to the Bone is properly called <hi>Epiphy≈øis,</hi> the Appendage; and that part that bunches out beyond the plain ≈øurface, is called <hi>Apophy≈øis,</hi> or the Proce≈øs.</p>
                        <p>In relation to this di≈øcour≈øe of the Bones we ≈øhall divide the Body into three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, the Trunk and the Limbs. By the <hi>Head</hi> is implied both Head and Neck. The fir≈øt and uppermo≈øt Part of the Head is the Skull, called <hi>Cranium,</hi> becau≈øe it is as it were <hi>Cranos</hi> an Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to the Brain. It is compounded of ≈øeveral Bones to the number of fifteen or ≈øeventeen in Humane Bodies, ≈øay mo≈øt Anatomi≈øts, that is, in all, as well little as big; for of the large ones there are but nine, three of which are common to the Skull with the upper Jaw-bone, which are the Wedge-like Bone or <hi>cuneiforme,</hi> the Yoke-bone, and <hi>≈øpongio≈øum,</hi> the ≈øpongy or Sieve-like Bone. The other ≈øix are proper Bones and make up the Skull it ≈øelf; and tho≈øe are the Fore-head Bone, the Noll-bone, the two Bones of the <hi>Synciput,</hi> and the two Temple-bones, in which la≈øt are contained (in each of them) three ≈ømall Bones, of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy treated where we ≈øpoke of the Parts of the Ear in the third Book at Chap. 14. namely the Hammer, the Anvil and the Stirrup, all which make up the ≈øaid number of fifteen Bones of the Skull; to which if we add the lately found-out Bone of the Ear, called the orbicular Bone, there will be ≈øeventeen. Now the larger Bones are divided or di≈øtingui≈øhed by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57416:139"/>≈øeveral Seams called Sutures, and both Bones and Sutures are of the ≈øame number in this Animal we are treating of as in Men, as may be ≈øeen by the following Figure.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Sutures or Seams of the Head.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>A Suture what, and of how many kinds. The Sutures are proper or common. The proper are true or fal≈øe. 1. True Sutures are The Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 2. The Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doidal. 3. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittal. The fal≈øe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are two. The common Sutures are 1. Frontalis. 2. Cuncifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis. 3. Cribro≈øa. The u≈øe of the Sutures.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>A <hi>Suture</hi> is the connexion of one Bone of the Head to another, of which there are two ≈øorts: the one is plain and linear, like two boards glewed or ≈øtones cemented together; the other indented like the teeth of two Saws put tooth within tooth.</p>
                        <p>Of the≈øe Sutures ≈øome are <hi>proper</hi> to the Skull alone, and ≈øome are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to it with the upper Jaw. The <hi>proper</hi> Sutures are again double, that is to ≈øay, <hi>true</hi> or <hi>fal≈øe.</hi> Of the former ≈øort are tho≈øe Saw-like ones before-named, which are three in number, <hi>viz.</hi> Coronal, Lambdoidal and Sagittal; and of the latter are the plain ones, which ≈øome reckon to be more, ≈øome fewer.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the Saw-like ones is called in Humane Skulls <hi>Coronalis</hi> or the Crown-Suture, becau≈øe the Ancients were wont to wear their Crowns or Garlands in that place. This Suture, as in Men, ≈øo likewi≈øe in a Hor≈øe runs overthwart the Skull above the Fore-head, reaching from the Temple-bone of one ≈øide to the Temple-bone on the other, joining the <hi>Os frontis</hi> or Fore-head-bone to the <hi>Synciput</hi> or Bone of the fore-part of the Head.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is called <hi>Lambdoides</hi> or Lambdoidal Suture, as re≈øembling in its dimen≈øion the Greek letter Œõ <hi>lambda.</hi> This is ≈øeated on the back-part of the Head, being oppo≈øite to the former, beginning at the bottom of the <hi>Occiput,</hi> from whence it a≈øcends obliquely to either Ear in Men, but in a Hor≈øe ≈øomething above the Ear, running with a more ≈ølanting line. It joins the Bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> to the Bones of the <hi>Synciput</hi> and Temples.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> runs not overthwart the Head as the two former, but lengthways of it, reaching in Humane Skulls from the top or middle of the Lambdoidal to the middle of the Coronal Suture onely; but in Hor≈øes it reaches further (as it does in Children) cro≈ø≈øing the Coronal Suture, and runs afterward down the Fore-head-bone to the No≈øe. This is not ≈øo Saw-like in Hor≈øes Skulls as the other two are, as may be ≈øeen by the foregoing Figure. It is the la≈øt of the true or Saw-like Sutures, and hath the name of Sagittal, from its ≈øtreightne≈øs, its cour≈øe being ≈øtreight like an <hi>Arrow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next come we to the <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> counterfeit or ba≈øtard proper Sutures, which are tho≈øe that re≈øemble a Line onely, and are not Saw-like at all. The≈øe are in number two; the fir≈øt of which pa≈ø≈øeth from the Root of the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus mammillaris</hi> upwards with a circular Duct, and pa≈ø≈øeth downwards again towards the bottom of the Ear, after it hath compa≈ø≈øed in the Temple-bone. By this Seam are the Bones of the <hi>Synciput, Occiput</hi> and <hi>Sphenoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> joined with the Temple-bones.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond of the ba≈øtard proper Sutures runs obliquely downwards, ari≈øing from the ≈øide or rather top of the former, and runs down toward the Socket of the Eye, to the beginning of the fir≈øt common Suture.</p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:57416:140"/>
                        <p>The <hi>common</hi> Sutures are tho≈øe that belong not to the Skull alone, but are common to it with the Wedge-like Bone and the upper Jaw. Of which the≈øe that follow are the mo≈øt remarkable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> the <hi>Frontalis,</hi> by which the outer Proce≈øs of the Fore-head-bone is joined with the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is that which is called <hi>Cuneiformis</hi> or Wedge-like, by which the Wedge-like-bone is joined with the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is called <hi>Cribro≈øa,</hi> which is common to the Wedge-like-bone, and the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> or partition of the No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the≈øe Sutures or Seams are, fir≈øt, to be vents of the Brain, through which the impure and ≈øooty excrements might exhale or evaporate; ≈øecondly, to help to ≈øtay the Brain from tottering, and its parts from being mi≈øplaced in violent motions, by giving way to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres that pa≈øs through them from the <hi>Dura mater</hi> within, to the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> without the Skull, by which Fibres the ≈øaid <hi>dura mater</hi> and al≈øo the Brain it ≈øelf (which is wrapt within it) is kept ≈øu≈øpended as it were, that ≈øo the hardne≈øs of the Skull might not offend it by pre≈ø≈øing again≈øt it, nor the Brains own weight bear too hard upon the bottom of the Skull, which it would be apt to do were it not for its being thus born up or ≈øu≈øpended by the≈øe Fibres that tie the <hi>Dura mater</hi> to the out≈øide of the Skull.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Sutures were al≈øo made for the ingre≈øs and egre≈øs of the Ve≈ø≈øels, for the life and nouri≈øhment of the Parts contained within the Skull.</p>
                        <p>La≈øtly, that if at any time the Head ≈øhould happen to be broken, the fracture might not run through the whole Skull, but ≈øtay at the end of the fractured Bone; whereas were it not for the≈øe Seams, it would like an earthen Pot with one knock or fall be in danger of being ≈øhivered all in pieces, which it is not now ≈øo apt to do, for the crack will not ≈øo ea≈øily pa≈øs over a Seam as it would run along an intire bone.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Bones of the Skull are proper or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The proper are ≈øix. 1. The Fore-head-bone. Its Cavities. Its Holes.

Their ≈øhape, ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and holes. 3 The Os occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis. Its ≈øhape and connexion. Its Sinus.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Bones of the Skull are of two ≈øorts, <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>common.</hi> Of the fir≈øt in this Chapter; and of the latter in the next.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>proper</hi> are in number ≈øix; one of the Fore-head, another of the hinder-part of the Head or <hi>Occiput,</hi> two of the Crown, and two of the Temples, all which are divided or di≈øtingui≈øhed from one another by the before-named Sutures.</p>
                        <p>The Fore-head-bone, called <hi>Os frontis,</hi> is ≈øeated before, and maketh the fore-part of the Skull, both above and a little below the Orbit of the Eyes. It is bounded before by the Coronal and fir≈øt common Suture, on the ≈øides by the Temporal Bones, and on the in≈øide by the ≈øpongy Bones.</p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:57416:141"/>
                        <p>Betwixt the <hi>Laminae</hi> or Scales of this Bone at the top of the No≈øe there is a large (or rather double) <hi>Cavity,</hi> from whence two holes pa≈øs to the No≈øtrils, di≈øtingui≈øhed by many bony Fibres and ≈ømall Scales, which are encompa≈ø≈øed with a green Membrane, and contain a ≈øoft medullar, or as it were an oylie body.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> a≈øcribed to the≈øe Cavities are various: as fir≈øt, to prepare the air that is drawn in by the No≈øtrils, for the generation of animal Spirits; ≈øecondly, to keep for ≈øome time the odoriferous air whereby ≈ømells may be more lei≈øurably perceived; thirdly, ≈øome think that they ≈øerve for the collection of flegmatick Excrements; and others, la≈øtly, that they a≈ø≈øi≈øt or promote the ≈øhrilne≈øs or echo of the Voice. I will not determine of the truth of any of the≈øe opinions; but ≈øhall onely ob≈øerve this further, that the≈øe Cavities are much larger in an Hor≈øe than they are in a Man, even the difference of the bulk of their Bodies con≈øidered.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Cavities there is al≈øo a Den or <hi>Sinus</hi> made of a double Scale; one of which being outermo≈øt maketh the upper (inward) part of the Orbit of the Eye, and is plain; the other maketh the Cavity above the Eyes on either ≈øide, and is not plain, but hath in≈øcriptions an≈øwerable to the winding convolutions of the Brain, who≈øe bunching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out portions it receives.</p>
                        <p>This Fore-head-bone hath al≈øo two <hi>Holes</hi> in the middle part of the Eye-brow, which go to the Orbit of the Eye, by which the fir≈øt branch of the Nerve of the fifth conjugation of the Brain goeth to the Mu≈øcle of the Fore-head.</p>
                        <p>It hath al≈øo four <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi> two of which are ≈øeated at the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Eye, and other two at its le≈ø≈øer, all helping to make the upper part of the Orbit.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the Bones of the <hi>Synciput</hi> or fore-part of the Head, which are in number two, being joined before with the Bone of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head by the Coronal Suture, with the <hi>Os occipitis</hi> behind, by the Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doidal Suture, on each ≈øide to the Temple-bones by the ≈øcaly Sutures, and to the Wedge-like-bone by one of the common Sutures. They are al≈øo joyned together, or one to another, in the middle or top of the Head (lengthways) by a Suture common to them both, called the Sagittal Suture.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>figure</hi> is almo≈øt four-≈øquare; their <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> thinner than that of the other Bones, yet con≈øi≈øt of two plates, ≈øave in their lower edges, where they are joined to the Temple-bones. On the out≈øide they are ≈ømooth, but on the in≈øide uneven, having ≈øeveral ≈øhallow Cavities or Dens by the ≈øides of the Sagittal Suture, to which the <hi>Dura mater</hi> firmly grows; as al≈øo many long and winding in≈øcriptions or furrows for the Ve≈ø≈øels which run from the internal Jugulars through the ≈øaid <hi>Dura mater</hi> to the Brain. They have likewi≈øe ≈øeveral perforations or little <hi>holes,</hi> ≈øome of which indeed penetrate but one Plate, which are for the entrance and exit of the Ve≈ø≈øels that run between the Plates; but mo≈øt run quite through them, and are made for ≈ømall Veins and Arteries to pa≈øs both from within outwards, and from without inwards.</p>
                        <p>Next is the <hi>Os occipitis,</hi> or Noll-bone, which makes the hinder and lower part of the Head, and the middle part al≈øo of the ba≈øis of the Skull. It is of a very hard ≈øub≈øtance, harder than any Bone of the Skull be≈øides, (except the <hi>Os petro≈øum</hi> of the Temple-bones) being thicker at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom where it is without fle≈øh, and where the two <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Dura
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57416:141"/>mater</hi> are joined. At the ≈øides of the great perforation (through which the Spinal Marrow de≈øcends) it is ≈øomewhat thin and without any Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or ≈ømall Dens in it; but that its thinne≈øs here might be no prejudice to it, from the edge of this perforation there a≈øcends on the in≈øide a large Proce≈øs or Prominence running along to its top, to ≈øtrengthen it and arm it again≈øt any accidents that might happen by blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence it is that di≈øtingui≈øhes the two Protuberances of the <hi>Cerebellum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Bone is in ≈øhape five-corner'd, by two of which corners it is joined in its upper part to the Bones of the <hi>Synciput</hi> by the Lambdoidal Suture; by two other in its fore-≈øides to the Temple-bones by one of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Sutures; and by its fifth corner to the <hi>Os cuneiforme,</hi> or Wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bone.</p>
                        <p>It hath in it ≈øeveral <hi>Sinus's</hi> or Chanels, of which ≈øome are on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide,and others on the out≈øide of it. Of tho≈øe on the <hi>in≈øide</hi> there are two which are pretty large, ordained for the receiving the protuberances or bunchings out of the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> or After-brain. The others on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide are ≈øome to receive the protuberances of the Brain it ≈øelf; others to receive the two <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> that they might not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed by the Bones of the Skull; and the re≈øt are for the like u≈øes. The two that are on the <hi>out≈øide</hi> of this Bone, are in its lower part by the ≈øides of the great perforation, of a ≈øemicircular ≈øhape.</p>
                        <p>This Bone hath al≈øo ≈øeveral <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi> four of which being clad with a glib Gri≈øtle are received into ≈øo many <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. But that is the mo≈øt con≈øiderable which I mentioned before, and ≈øerves to ≈øtrengthen the Bone. It has <hi>Holes</hi> to the number of five; the fir≈øt is in the mid≈øt of the bottom of the Noll, which is the large≈øt of all the inward holes of the Head, being in ≈øhape round and ≈øomewhat long, through which the <hi>Medulla oblongata</hi> or Spinal Marrow pa≈ø≈øeth out of the Skull into the Cavity of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck. The other four are le≈øs by far, and are made for the tran≈øition of ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Temple-bones</hi> come next to be treated of, which are ≈øeated on the ≈øides of the Skull and reach to the bottom of the Ears. They are joyned on their upper part to the out≈øide of the Bones of the Crown by the Suture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Squamo≈øa,</hi> or Scale-like. In their fore-part they are joined to the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw, by its fir≈øt Proce≈øs; and their hinder-part is joined to the <hi>Os occipitis,</hi> by one of the counterfeit Sutures.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of the Temple-bone is in its upper part ample, equal and ≈øemicircular; but below, it is very ≈øhapele≈øs, like to a rude, rugged and unequal Rock, from whence as al≈øo from its hardne≈øs it hath its name of <hi>Petro≈øum,</hi> or the Rocky-bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> of this Bone is al≈øo full of variety; for at its bottom it is thick and rugged; but as it a≈øcends, by degrees it grows much thinner, and at its top is ≈øo thin that it is almo≈øt tran≈øparent, (e≈øpecially where it gives way to the Temporal Mu≈øcle) and like a Scale lies upon the lower edge of the Bone of the <hi>Synciput,</hi> which Bone in its de≈øcent under the Temple-bone is al≈øo attenuated.</p>
                        <p>The Temple-bones have each of them two <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavities. The <hi>outer</hi> of the≈øe is much larger than the other, being lined with a Cartilage or Gri≈øtle, ≈øeated betwixt the Auditory pa≈ø≈øage and the Proce≈øs of the Yoke-bone. It is of an indifferent length, running as it were tran≈øver≈øly or overthwart, and has the longer Proce≈øs or the head of the lower Jaw in≈øerted or articulated into it. The other Cavity is <hi>inward</hi> at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57416:142"/>of the Proce≈øs of the Yoke-bone, and is common to the Temple-bone with the Noll-bone.</p>
                        <p>By the≈øe <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavities there ≈øtands a ≈øharp and longi≈øh, and (in Hor≈øes) pretty thick (but in Men far more long and ≈ølender) Appendix, from its ≈øhape in Humane Bodies called <hi>Os ≈øtyloides,</hi> the Pen-like Bone. Be≈øides which there are al≈øo three <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes;</hi> two of which are external, and one internal.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt external</hi> is blunt, thick and ≈øhort, (≈øaid to be ≈øomewhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low within) tending downwards, in ≈øhape ≈øomething like to the Nipple of a Cow, from whence it is called <hi>Mammillaris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the <hi>outward</hi> Proce≈ø≈øes runs forward from the hole of the Ear to the Proce≈øs of the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw, both of them fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> or Yoke-bone. For the≈øe two Proce≈ø≈øes, one of the Temple-bone and the other of the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw, being join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an oblong Suture do make the fa≈øhion (as it were) of a Bridge, or of an Oxes Yoke, from whence that Bone hath its name, and of which we ≈øhall treat further in the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> Proce≈øs, which is <hi>internal,</hi> is that which is called the Rocky-bone. It is pretty long, jetting out to the in≈øide of the bottom of the Skull, within which it hath two <hi>holes,</hi> through one of which an Artery, and through the other the Auditory Nerve pa≈øs to the inner <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities</hi> of the Ear, which are three in number, namely the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum, the <hi>Labyrinthus</hi> or Labyrinth, and the <hi>Cochlea,</hi> or Snail-≈øhell. On the out≈øide of the Skull this Proce≈øs has three perforations or holes. The fir≈øt and large≈øt of which is called <hi>meatus Auditorius,</hi> or the hole of hearing. The ≈øecond is narrow, ≈øhort and oblique, near to the fir≈øt, by the fir≈øt hole of the Wedge-like Bone. Through this the Jugular Vein enters into the inner Cavities of the Skull. The third hole is ≈øeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Proce≈ø≈øus mammillaris</hi> and the <hi>Styloides</hi> or Pen-like <hi>Appendix,</hi> ending into that pa≈ø≈øage that goes from the Ear to the Mouth. As to the little Bones that lie hid in the Cavities of this Proce≈øs, by ancient Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øts they were reckoned to be but three, but there is by modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours added a fourth; and they are commonly known by the≈øe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing names, <hi>viz. Incus, Malleus, Stapes,</hi> and <hi>Os orbiculare,</hi> of all which I have already treated in the fourteenth Chapter of the Third Book, where they are al≈øo lively repre≈øented in Figures, to which place I refer the Reader for his further ≈øatisfaction; having not mentioned them in this place, but that they make up the number of the <hi>proper</hi> Bones of the Skull.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Bones common to the Skull and upper Jaw.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>1 The Wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bone. Its ≈øituation. Its Proce≈ø≈øes. Its Cavities. Its Holes. 2 The Sieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bone. Its ≈øituation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. Its Parts. Its <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe. 3 Os jugale.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving hitherto treated of the Bones <hi>proper</hi> to the Skull onely, I come now to treat of tho≈øe which are <hi>common</hi> to it with the upper Jaw; and the≈øe are in number three, namely, the <hi>Os ≈øphenoides</hi> or <hi>cunei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi> the <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> and the <hi>Os jugale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe is the <hi>Sphenoides,</hi> or Wedge-like Bone, ≈øo called from its ≈øituation, which is betwixt the Bones of the Skull and the upper Jaw, and not from the likene≈øs of its figure to that of a Wedge, as ≈øome do believe. It is joined before to the Fore-head-bone, and behind to the <hi>Os occipitis.</hi> At the ≈øides it doth a good part of it join to the <hi>Os petro≈øum.</hi> Above, it is joined to the fir≈øt, fourth and ≈øixth Bones of the upper Jaw; and below, to the Bones of the Palate of the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>It hath ≈øeveral <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi> of which ≈øome are external, and ≈øome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The <hi>internal</hi> are four, ≈øtanding out like four feet of a Table or Chair, which (taking in the ≈øpace between them) form the <hi>Sella Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cica.</hi> The <hi>external</hi> are al≈øo four, of which the two <hi>formo≈øt</hi> are contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the upper Jaw, and are called the Wing-like Proce≈ø≈øes, from the re≈øemblance they have to Bats-wings; for they are thick in ≈øome places, and yet end into a notable thinne≈øs, almo≈øt as thin and ≈øharp as the edge of a Knife. The two <hi>hinder</hi> are ≈øtretched out toward the <hi>Styloides</hi> Proce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of the Temple-bones.</p>
                        <p>This Bone hath ≈øeveral <hi>Cavities</hi> or hollowne≈ø≈øes; two of which are common with it and the Temple-bones, and the Bones of the <hi>Synciput.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It hath al≈øo many perforations or little <hi>Holes</hi> to the number of ≈øeven on each ≈øide. One of which being round gives a pa≈ø≈øage to the Optick Nerve toward the Eye. The re≈øt are penetrated ≈øome by one, ≈øome by ≈øeveral pairs of Nerves; others by the Carotid Arteries and Jugular Veins; and others again by both Nerves and Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>The next common Bone of the Head and upper Jaw is the <hi>Os cribri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi> ≈øo called from the ≈øeveral or indeed innumerable little holes in it, which make it like a <hi>Sieve,</hi> through which holes the ≈ømells do pa≈øs to the Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes, or Olfactory Nerves. It is ≈øituated in the fore-part of the Skull, between or a little below the Sockets of the Eyes, under the middle ba≈øis of the Fore-head-bone, and at the upper part of the No≈øtrils. It is joined by a plain or ≈øimple line to the Fore-head-bone, the ≈øecond Bone of the upper Jaw, and to the <hi>Os cuneiforme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Bone is by ≈øome divided into <hi>four parts;</hi> of which the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is a Proce≈øs in the upper and middle part of it, which is long and triangular, ending in a ≈øharp point, whence it is called <hi>Cri≈øta galli,</hi> or the Cock's Comb. This runs in betwixt the Mammillary Proce≈ø≈øes dividing them one from the other. To its ≈øharp point the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Falx</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> part of this Bone is that which mo≈øt properly is called <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> being perforated all over like a Sieve, ≈øome of which holes are ≈øtreight and ≈øome oblique. They are ob≈øerved to be much larger in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57416:144"/>Dogs than in any other Animal (allowing for the proportion of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) which is ≈øuppo≈øed the rea≈øon why their ≈ømell is more exqui≈øite than that of any other Creature.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> part is a Proce≈øs in its lower or under ≈øide oppo≈øite to the upper Proce≈øs; which part divideth the upper part of the No≈øe into two No≈øtrils, whence it is called <hi>≈øeptum Na≈øi,</hi> the Partition-bone of the No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and la≈øt part of this Bone is compared to a Sponge or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice-≈øtone, being porous and full of ≈ømall cavities, which are filled with a ≈øpongie fle≈øh; and from this part the whole Bone is by ≈øome called <hi>Os ≈øpongio≈øum.</hi> For the names of <hi>cribriforme</hi> and <hi>≈øpongio≈øum</hi> are confounded one with the other, being either of them given indifferently to the whole Bone. But if we will con≈øider the <hi>≈øpongio≈øum</hi> onely as a part of the <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briforme,</hi> then we mu≈øt ≈øay, that it is that part of it that is ≈øeated ju≈øt at the top of the No≈øtrils. Some make two Bones of it, affixing one at the top of each No≈øtril, and call them in the plural number <hi>O≈ø≈øa ≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio≈øa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> a≈øcribed to the <hi>Os cribriforme</hi> by mo≈øt Anatomi≈øts hath been to di≈øcharge through its pores or holes flegmatick excrements from the Brain into the No≈øe, but he that ≈øhall examine them, will find that its holes are ≈øo filled either with the ≈øpongie fle≈øh before-named, or el≈øe with the Fibres of the ≈ømelling Nerves pa≈ø≈øing through them to the in≈øide of the No≈øtrils, that there is no pa≈ø≈øage left for any humour by them. What we therefore account their true u≈øe to be, the Reader may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if he plea≈øe to turn back to the fifteenth Chapter of the Third Book, where we treated of the No≈øe, and de≈øcribed its u≈øes: adding to what is there ≈øaid of it, that it makes up the inner corner of the Orbit of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> and la≈øt Bone common to the Skull and upper Jaw is called <hi>Os jugale,</hi> or the Yoke-bone. This is ≈øeated on each ≈øide of the Hor≈øe's Face between the <hi>meatus</hi> of the Ear or Auditory pa≈ø≈øage, and the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw; being framed of two Bones, one of which is a Proce≈øs of the Temple-bone that is carried from the <hi>meatus Auditorius,</hi> and is the hinder of them; and the other Bone being the foremore is a Proce≈øs of the fir≈øt Bone of the upper Jaw, and which maketh the lower ≈øide of the le≈ø≈øer or outer corner of the Eye. The≈øe two are joined by a ≈ølanting or oblique Suture, and being ≈øo joined do con≈øtitute this Bone called <hi>Os ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> Over this Bone runs the Tendon of the Temporal-mu≈øcle, and al≈øo the Tendon of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øeter</hi> or Chewing-mu≈øcle, as they pa≈øs to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Jaw.</p>
                        <p>Some make but two common Bones of the Skull and upper Jaw, not reckoning this for any particular Bone, ≈øeeing (as has been ≈øaid) it is formed onely of the two Proce≈ø≈øes of the Temple and upper Jaw-bone. But ≈øeeing it is di≈øtingui≈øhed from the others by a particular name (though not of any peculiar ≈øub≈øtance) I thought it not ab≈øurd to reckon it for a <hi>third</hi> common Bone.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Bones of the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>lower Jaws</hi> come next to be ≈øpoken to, with the fir≈øt of which we will begin.</p>
                        <p>This Jaw hath Bones of two ≈øorts, the one proper to it ≈øelf, and the other common to it and the Skull. The <hi>common</hi> Bones are the Wedge-like and Sieve-like Bones, and the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> of which we have already treated in the foregoing Chapter. I ≈øhall therefore proceed to treat of the Bones <hi>proper</hi> to the upper Jaw onely, which make the lower ≈øide of the Orbit of the Eye, the No≈øe, Cheeks and Roof of the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>The Bones that con≈øtitute all the≈øe Parts are twelve in number, on each ≈øide of the Face ≈øix; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is called <hi>Zygomaticum,</hi> becau≈øe by its Proce≈øs it makes up the greate≈øt part of the <hi>Os jugale.</hi> This is ≈øeated at, and maketh, the lower part of the outer corner of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>next</hi> is a round, little, brittle and thin Bone, ≈øeated in the inner corner of the Eye, called <hi>Os lachrymale,</hi> becau≈øe it has a hole in it through which the ≈øerous humour that makes the tears in Men doth i≈ø≈øue. Upon this hole the little Kernel called <hi>caruncula Lachrymalis</hi> re≈øteth, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the continual gleeting of the fore≈øaid humour. There is al≈øo in the lower part of this Bone another hole which goes to the cavity of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtril, through which doth pa≈øs a branch of the fifth pair of Nerves to the inner Skin of the No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is ≈øeated in the inner ≈øide of the Eye, and within is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the fungous Bones of the No≈øtrils. It is broad, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quadrangular or four-corner'd, al≈øo thin and tran≈øparent, like the Scale of a Fi≈øh. On its out≈øide it is ≈ømooth, but within rugged and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, becau≈øe of the Scales that cleave unto it. It is joined to four Bones, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Fore-head-bone, to the Wedge-like Bone, to the ≈øecond Bone of the Jaw, (<hi>viz.</hi> the next foregoing) and al≈øo to the fourth, or next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. It is not known by any peculiar name; I have therefore made bold to call it <hi>Os innominatum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Bone is called <hi>Os malae,</hi> the Cheek-bone, becau≈øe it maketh up the greate≈øt part of the <hi>Cheek,</hi> as al≈øo of the Palate. It likewi≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the upper Teeth in its cavities or caverns. It is much larger than any other Bone of the upper Jaw, and is circum≈øcribed with many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for not to mention the Teeth that are inarticulated into it, it abut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon or is joined to ≈øeveral Bones. In the fir≈øt place it is joined above, on the ≈øide next the No≈øe, to the Bone of the Fore-head; below, to the Wedge-like Bone, and the Bone of the Palate of the Mouth; before, to the <hi>Os lachrymale,</hi> and to the fifth Bone that makes the upper part of the No≈øe, (which is next to be de≈øcribed;) and la≈øtly to its own companion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cheek-bone of one ≈øide to that of the other.</p>
                        <p>This Bone hath three perforations or <hi>holes,</hi> two of which are under the Orbit of the Eye; that is, on each ≈øide one, running from the lower part of the Eye outward. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to tran≈ømit or let pa≈øs two branches of the fifth pair of Nerves out of the Orbit of the Eye to the Face, on the Parts whereof they are be≈øtowed.</p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:57416:145"/>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> of the≈øe holes is in the Palate, at the back≈øide of the Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-teeth where both Bones of the Jaw meet. It is pre≈øently divided into two, one of which runneth on one ≈øide of the <hi>≈øeptum</hi> of the No≈øe, and the other on the other, to the No≈øtrils, to which there pa≈øs through the≈øe holes a ≈ømall Vein and a ≈ømall Artery.</p>
                        <p>It hath al≈øo a den or cavity on each ≈øide, by the ≈øide of the No≈øe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Orbit of the Eye, which is covered with a very fine Membrane. This is often full of a mucous or ≈ølimy phlegm.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Bone of the upper Jaw doth with his companion make the bony prominence of the No≈øe. It is a ≈ømall Bone, in figure almo≈øt four-≈øquare. It is hard, ≈øolid, and rea≈øonable thick, having ≈øundry ≈ømall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forations in it. It is joined above to the Fore-head-bone, <hi>viz.</hi> to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Proce≈øs. In the ≈øides above it is joined to the fir≈øt Bone, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower to the fourth Bone of this Jaw. In the middle it is joined to its companion, and below to the Gri≈øtles that make the lower part of the No≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øixth</hi> is that which makes up the Roof of the Mouth, with its companion; for you mu≈øt reckon every one of the≈øe Bones double, one on one ≈øide of the Face, and another on the other. It is a broad Bone, thin and ≈øolid, and in the end, where it is rough, it re≈øembleth a ≈øemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle. It is joined behind to the Wing-like Proce≈ø≈øes of the Wedge-like Bone, and on the in≈øide, to the Partition-bone of the No≈øtrils. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe joined to the fourth Bone of this Jaw or Cheek-bone, and la≈øtly to his companion or fellow in its back-part.</p>
                        <p>This Bone hath al≈øo two perforations, on either ≈øide one, running up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward to two of the holes of the Wedge-like Bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>lower</hi> Jaw comes next to be treated of, which makes the lower part of the capacity of the Mouth. This differs from the former in that it is moveable, whereas the upper is not. In ≈øhape it is long and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. At both the ends of it, there are two <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes,</hi> which are by ≈øome called <hi>Horns.</hi> The <hi>foremo≈øt</hi> of them runs upward, and from a broad ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis grows ≈øharp, ending into a cone or point. This point receives the Tendon of the Temporal Mu≈øcle, which Tendon compa≈ø≈øeth it round about, and is ≈øtrongly implanted into it: from whence it is that a luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lower Jaw, becau≈øe of the di≈øtention of this Tendon that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens thereupon, is very dangerous, and hard to cure.</p>
                        <p>The other being the <hi>backward</hi> Proce≈øs, is called <hi>Articularis,</hi> becau≈øe it ≈øerves for articulation. This hath a neck and a longi≈øh head, (called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylus</hi>) that is covered with a Cartilage for its ea≈øier motion: By this head it is articulated into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of <hi>Os petro≈øum,</hi> that is al≈øo lined with a Cartilage, and is knit thereto ≈øtrongly by a membranous Ligament. At the ≈øides and roots of the≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes it hath ≈øhallow Sinus's or Cavities in its ≈øurface, but they are deeper on the in≈øide than on the out≈øide. The principal u≈øe of both ≈øeemeth to be for the pa≈ø≈øage or in≈øertion of the Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>This Bone of the lower Jaw is very hard, and for the mo≈øt part very ≈øolid, to make it the ≈øtronger. Yet on each ≈øide (more backward than in Men) it hath a Cavity within it, which contains a marrowy juice for its nouri≈øhment. It hath al≈øo four perforations or holes, of which two are at the roots of the Proce≈ø≈øes, by which a branch of the fifth pair of Nerves, as al≈øo a Vein and Artery do pa≈øs to the Teeth. The two other
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57416:146"/>holes are in its fore-part by the ≈øides of the Chin, through which two twigs of the ≈øaid fifth branch of Nerves do pa≈øs out again to the lower Lip, and its Mu≈øcles and Skin.</p>
                        <p>This lower Jaw as well as the upper hath Sockets for the Teeth to ≈øtand in, in number equall to the Teeth, which Sockets are called by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins <hi>Alveoli</hi> or little Pits. The≈øe are digged deep, that the Teeth like ≈øo many Nails might be the firmlier fa≈øtned in them. When any of the Teeth fall out of them, (as the Foal-teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in a ≈øhort time they are obliterated, the Jaw becoming ≈ømooth without any pit in it in that place.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Teeth</hi> are called in Latin <hi>Dentes, qua≈øi Edentes,</hi> from <hi>eating.</hi>They are of a very hard ≈øub≈øtance, yea, harder than any of the other Bones in the whole Body. That part of them that ≈øtands out above the Gumm, is ≈ømooth and free from any covering; but that part that is within the Sockets of the Jaws is more rough and covered with a thin Membrane or <hi>Perio≈øteum,</hi> which Membrane is of exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe. Tho≈øe ≈øort of them which we call the Grinding teeth, have a manife≈øt Cavity within, but the <hi>Inci≈øores</hi> (or Fore-teeth) and Dog-teeth have but very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure ones. Into the≈øe Cavities by the very ≈ømall holes that are in the roots of the Teeth, are received (into each Tooth) a Capillary Artery from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides,</hi> al≈øo a ≈ømall Vein from the Jugulars, and a twig of a Nerve from the fifth pair; which Nerve being expanded through the thin Membrane that inve≈øts the ≈øaid Cavity, gives it a mo≈øt acute ≈øen≈øe; whereas the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Tooth is of it ≈øelf in≈øen≈øible. The≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, namely, the Vein, Artery and Nerve, are united together and cloathed with a common Coat when they enter the Jaw, within which they have a proper chanel to run along in under the roots of the Teeth, to each of which roots they ≈øend ≈ømall twigs as they pa≈øs by, as afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:57416:148"/>
                        <p>As in Men, ≈øo in Hor≈øes, there are three kinds of Teeth, namely, <hi>Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øores, Canini</hi> and <hi>Molares.</hi> The <hi>Inci≈øores,</hi> Cutters or Shredders are tho≈øe we call the Fore-teeth from their being ≈øeated in the fore-part of the Jaw. They are ≈øharp-edged like a Knife, and broad al≈øo, that they may the better bite off or crop the Gra≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are in number twelve, that is to ≈øay, in each Jaw ≈øix. They have each but one root or phang, though that root is indifferent large, mo≈øt times larger than any one of the phangs of the great or Grinding-teeth.</p>
                        <p>The next to the≈øe are tho≈øe which in Hor≈øes we call the <hi>Tu≈øhes,</hi> but in Men they are called the Dog-teeth or <hi>Canini,</hi> not onely becau≈øe in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure they are like the Teeth of a Dog, and ≈øtand out of the Gumms as Dog's-teeth do; but from their u≈øe al≈øo, which is to gnaw upon and break (with their ≈øharp points) what is too hard for the Fore-teeth to cut or ≈øhear in ≈øunder. The roots of the≈øe as of the former are ≈øingle, having but one phang.</p>
                        <p>Tho≈øe of the third rank, are the double Teeth, which are called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares,</hi> or Grinders, becau≈øe the Meat is broken or ground by them, even as Corn is ground by the Mill-≈øtone. The≈øe are in Hor≈øes twenty four in number, in each Jaw twelve. Their ≈øeat is in the inner part of the Mouth, being environed in their out≈øide by the Cheeks, le≈øt the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or ≈øhredded Meat, being rowled by the Tongue upon the Teeth, ≈øhould ≈ølip over them out of the Mouth, before it be ≈øufficiently ground.</p>
                        <p>The two foremo≈øt of the≈øe Teeth, ≈øtanding next to the Dog-teeth or Tu≈øhes, are tho≈øe by which the age of an Hor≈øe is known till after ≈øeven years old, and that by their unevenne≈øs at the top, having ≈øeveral little thin ≈øhells or ≈øcales as it were ≈øticking up round the out≈øide of the top of them, whereby their middle part is made to appear hollow; which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowne≈øs where it is found, is a certain ≈øign of the Hor≈øe's being under ≈øeven years of age. And it is al≈øo to be ob≈øerved, that the nearer the Hor≈øe comes to that age, the more doth that hollowne≈øs grow out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: ≈øo that when he comes to be full ≈øeven years old it is quite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, and ≈øo the Hor≈øe's age to be no more known by that ≈øign, being pa≈øt the mark in the Mouth as we ≈øay: for by the perpetual u≈øe that the Hor≈øe makes of his Teeth, the before-mentioned Shells at the top of them, which cau≈øe their hollowne≈øs, are worn down even with the other parts of the Teeth, ≈øo that the whole top of the Tooth becomes even, ≈ømooth and plain.</p>
                        <p>Neither are the re≈øt of the Grinding-teeth without ≈øome hollowne≈øs or at lea≈øt roughne≈øs in their tops; but this is of a different nature from the other: which roughne≈øs or unevenne≈øs is very nece≈ø≈øary, for by it they are made more fit for the comminution of the Meat: For as Millers when their Mil≈øtones are grown ≈ømooth, do pick them anew, to make them grind the better; ≈øo hath Nature made the upper part of the≈øe Grinding-teeth, elegantly to imitate the rough ≈øuperficies of a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone, having here and there formed little pits in them. We ≈øhall not need to ≈øhew the u≈øes of the≈øe, or of either the foregoing ≈øorts of Teeth, that being intimated ≈øufficiently in the de≈øcription of them.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT Bone which is called <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> is of the ≈øhape of a Greek <hi>v (yp≈øilon)</hi> and is ≈øeated under (or at the root of) the Tongue, being as it were the foundation and ≈øupporter of it. It is compounded of three Bones, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the middle, (being larger than the other two) which is gibbous forwards (or outwards) and ≈øomewhat hollowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; by its gibbous ≈øide it is joined to the ba≈øis or bottom of the Tongue: The other two Bones are lateral, and are called <hi>Cornua,</hi> or Horns. To the fir≈øt Bone there are affixed two Gri≈øtles, and to each of the≈øe one. They are all tied to the adjacent parts, partly by a fle≈øhy, partly by a nervous ≈øub≈øtance. It hath three <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavities; above, a tran≈øver≈øe depre≈ø≈øed <hi>Sinus,</hi> to admit the ≈øecond pair of Mu≈øcles proper to it; and in the ≈øides of this <hi>Sinus</hi> there are two other, which give way unto the fir≈øt pair of Mu≈øcles that are implanted into the ≈øides of this Bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> of this Bone (although it be but a little one) is very great;for mo≈øt if not all the Mu≈øcles that move the Tongue either are in≈øerted into it or ari≈øe from it. It ≈øerves al≈øo to keep the Throat open, admitting the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> or Throat-flap into its bo≈øom, when it is lifted up in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And la≈øtly ≈øome of the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Larynx</hi> or Throttle ari≈øe from it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Collar-bones, their ≈øub≈øtance and u≈øe. The Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae of the Neck, their number and holes. 1 The fir≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed. 2 The ≈øecond, &amp;c. de≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving treated of the Bones of the <hi>Head,</hi> we come in the next place to ≈øpeak to tho≈øe of the <hi>Neck,</hi> which, in dividing the Body into three Parts at the beginning of this Fifth Book, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Head, Trunk and Limbs) we con≈øidered as annext to the Head. Its Bones are of two ≈øorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Collar or Chanel-bones, and the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> But fir≈øt of the <hi>Collar-bones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The≈øe are in number two, one on each ≈øide. They are called <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae,</hi> either from their re≈øembling the ≈øhape of old-fa≈øhioned Keys, which were of the ≈øhape of an Italick <hi>≈ø;</hi> or becau≈øe they lock up as it were and clo≈øe the Che≈øt; for by ≈øome they are accounted as belonging to <hi>it.</hi> Their ≈øub≈øtance is ≈øpongy and thick, e≈øpecially about their heads; but in their middle they are thin and flat. By one end they are joined to the top of the Brea≈øt-bone, and by the other to the fir≈øt Rack-bone of the Back, wherein they differ from tho≈øe in Man, which are jointed into
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57416:150"/>the Proce≈øs of the Shoulder-bone. Their <hi>u≈øe</hi> is to uphold the Shoulder-blades, that they ≈øhould not ≈ølide down upon the Brea≈øt together with the Shoulder-bone, which upon a di≈ølocation or fracture of the≈øe Collar-bones doth often come to pa≈øs.</p>
                        <p>The number of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Rack-bones of the <hi>Neck</hi> is ≈øeven, and they are reckoned from the Head downward; that next the Head being the fir≈øt. They have in each of them a large Cavity as tho≈øe of the Back and Loins have, to give way to the Spinal Marrow to de≈øcend by. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides this large hole which is common to the≈øe with tho≈øe others, they have al≈øo each of them two other ≈ømaller holes in their tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, through which the Cervical Veins and Arteries do pa≈øs to the Head. And betwixt their jointing one with another there is a third hole, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther half of one, for one half is formed out of the lower ≈øide of the upper, and the other out of the upper ≈øide of the lower <hi>Vertebra:</hi> By the≈øe the Nerves pa≈øs out from the Spinal Marrow.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the≈øe Bones is called <hi>Atlas,</hi> becau≈øe in Men the Head ≈øtands upon it like the Globe of the World, as the Poets feigned <hi>Atlas</hi> to bear the Cele≈øtial Globe upon his Shoulders. The body of this Bone is more ≈ølender, but ≈øolider than the re≈øt, and it wanteth its hinder Proce≈øs or Spine, having onely a kind of a ≈øemicircular knob jetting out in≈øtead of it: the rea≈øon of which ≈øeems to be, le≈øt the greater ≈øtreight pair of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Head that ≈øpring from the ≈øecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, and march over the back-≈øide of this, ≈øhould be hurt in bending the Head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But it has all its other Proce≈ø≈øes, <hi>viz.</hi> a≈øcending, de≈øcending and tran≈øver≈øe. Within on the fore-≈øide of its great <hi>Foramen,</hi> it has a <hi>Sinus,</hi> in ≈øhape ≈øemicircular, which is lined with a Cartilage or Gri≈øtle, and which receiveth the Tooth-like Proce≈øs of the ≈øecond <hi>Vertebra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond Vertebra</hi> is called <hi>Dentata,</hi> becau≈øe out of its upper ≈øide, between its two a≈øcending Proce≈ø≈øes, there ≈øprings an Appendix or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs, round and long, like the Dog-tooth in Man (or Tu≈øh in a Hor≈øe.) This Tooth is covered with a Cartilage, and is jointed into the fore≈øaid <hi>Sinus</hi> of the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra,</hi> and upon it, as upon an Axle-tree, the head turns round, from whence the whole Bone is called by ≈øome <hi>Axis.</hi> That part of the Tooth which enters not into the ≈øaid <hi>Sinus</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> its ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis) is encompa≈ø≈øed with a Ligament, which knits it to the <hi>Occiput.</hi> This and the four following have Spines or hinder Proce≈ø≈øes, each of which are divided into two for the better connexion of the Ligaments and Mu≈øcles to them. We ≈øhall not need to de≈øcribe particularly any more of them, ≈øeeing they are in all things like to the ≈øecond, ≈øaving that their lateral Proce≈ø≈øes are larger, and divided into two as well as the hinder: yea the ≈øeventh it ≈øelf differs not from the re≈øt, though in Man it do.</p>
                        <p>The bodies of the≈øe <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck are longer than tho≈øe of the Back or Loins; for though the Neck of an Hor≈øe be of ≈øo con≈øiderable length, yet as hath been ≈øaid its <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are but ≈øeven (as they are in Man) whereas tho≈øe of the Back and Loins are twenty four in all, which ≈øpace notwith≈øtanding is not ≈øo long again as the Neck is; whereas were the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of a proportionable length, it ≈øhould be more than three times the length.</p>

They have each of them on each ≈øide a <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavity for the inarticulation of the head of the Rib, which <hi>Sinus</hi> tho≈øe of the Neck want, as having no Bones to joint into them.</p>
                        <p>Note that the tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes of two or three of the lowe≈øt of the≈øe Racks begin to grow ≈øhorter and ≈øhorter, and their Spines are more blunt, and ≈øtand evener out, declining not ≈øo much downwards as tho≈øe before-going. As for the great Cavity or Perforation in the middle of the Bodies, it is proportionable to the Marrow which it contains.</p>
                        <p>Next to the Bones of the <hi>Neck</hi> we come to tho≈øe of the <hi>Loins,</hi> which make the third part of the Spine. They are in number ≈øeven, and are bigger than any of the fore-going either of the Neck or Back. Their hinder Proce≈ø≈øes or Spines are ≈øhorter, but broader and thicker than tho≈øe of the Back, ≈øomewhat bending upwards as mo≈øt of tho≈øe decline down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but as for the lateral or tran≈øver≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes, they exceed tho≈øe of the Back in length. The≈øe <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are joined one to another by a clammy Gri≈øtle, and likewi≈øe the uppermo≈øt of them to the la≈øt of the Back, and the lowe≈øt to the fir≈øt of <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> in like manner.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides their lateral Perforations betwixt their jointings for the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion or letting forth of the Nerves, they have al≈øo ≈øeveral other little holes for the intromi≈ø≈øion of the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels. As for their middle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration, nothing need be ≈øaid particularly of it, ≈øeeing it differs not from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57416:153"/>that of tho≈øe of the Back, being of capacity equal to the thickne≈øs of the Marrow that it contains.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ribs</hi> (in Latin <hi>Co≈øtae</hi>) are in number thirty four, that is to ≈øay, on each ≈øide ≈øeventeen. Their ≈øub≈øtance is partly bony, and partly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaginous or gri≈øtly; the fir≈øt ≈øerving for firmne≈øs, and the latter for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation, that upon occa≈øion they might yield a little without breaking. They are divided into two ≈øorts, the one called <hi>true,</hi> and the other the <hi>Ba≈øtard</hi>-ribs. The <hi>true</hi> are the nine uppermo≈øt, ≈øo called becau≈øe each with its fellow makes a compleat circle, being joined together by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Spondyls of the Back behind, and the Brea≈øt-bone before. I ≈øay the Ribs are articulated into the Back-bones behind, ≈øomething of a cartilaginous ≈øub≈øtance coming between: (the manner whereof is well expre≈øt in the following Figure.) At this articulation into the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> each Rib has two knobs, one of which is received into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Body of the <hi>Vertebra,</hi> and the other which is le≈øs, into that of the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe Proce≈øs. And they are joined before to the Brea≈øt-bone by way of articulation al≈øo; for their Cartilages end into little heads which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the ≈ømooth <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the Brea≈øt-bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ba≈øtard</hi>-ribs are the eight lower, being of a more ≈øoft and gri≈øtly ≈øub≈øtance than the other; becau≈øe being articulated onely at one end, it was nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould be of a more yielding and pliable nature, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe they would have been very apt to break. Yea their yielding is not onely a ≈øecurity to them≈øelves, but very convenient in re≈øpect to the parts that are contained under or within them. For ≈øeeing the Stomach lies in this region which u≈øes to be di≈øtended with Meat or Water, the≈øe Ribs ought to give way to it when it or the intermediate parts, as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Spleen, bear again≈øt them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of the Ribs is (as you may al≈øo ≈øee in the following Figure) ≈øemicircular, like a Bow when it is drawn; which Nature hath ≈øo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the Che≈øt ≈øtronger and more capacious.</p>
                        <p>They are on the out≈øide rough and unequal, e≈øpecially near the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> that the Ligaments might take the firmer hold on them, by which they are tied to the Rack-bones: but on their in≈øide they are ≈ømoother (being covered with the <hi>Pleura</hi>) le≈øt they ≈øhould hurt the Lungs and other Parts that bear again≈øt them. They are all of them narrower and roundi≈øh toward the Back, and broader and flatter toward the Brea≈øt. In their lower and inner part they have a furrow that runs along them, in which a Nerve and the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels are conducted.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the Ribs are, fir≈øt, to be a defence to the Bowels within the Brea≈øt, and to the Stomach, Liver and Spleen in the Lower Belly; and ≈øecondly, to ≈øupport the Mu≈øcles which ≈øerve for re≈øpiration, and to be moved by them: for which cau≈øe the Brea≈øt ought not to con≈øi≈øt of one Bone, for then it would have been immoveable; whereas now it ea≈øily admits of dilatation and contraction.</p>

                           <p>The Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Brea≈øt-bone in an Hor≈øe is not flat on the out≈øide as it is in Men, but ≈øtands out with a ridge, and is ≈øomething like the keel or bottom of a Boat, jetting out with its middle on the out≈øide, and is hollow on the in≈øide. It is of a ≈øpongy ≈øub≈øtance, neither ≈øo ≈øolid nor ≈øo white as mo≈øt of the other Bones of the Body. In Foals it is rather gri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than bony, and does then con≈øi≈øt of more parts than it does in grown Hor≈øes; for as by age the Gri≈øtles grow into a bony ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øo they do unite ≈øo one to another in time, that no foot≈øteps are left of their fir≈øt divi≈øion.</p>
                        <p>In its upper part towards the Throat it is rather pointed and ≈øharp, than horned as it is in Men; however on the in≈øide it is hollowed, for t he more convenient de≈øcent of the Wind-pipe. Without on each ≈øide of its upper end there is a little <hi>Sinus</hi> into which the heads of the Collar-bones are received or articulated. Betwixt which articulation of the Collar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones into it, and its lower end, there are ≈øeveral <hi>Sinus</hi> on each ≈øide of it, to the number of nine, into which the gri≈øtly ends of ≈øo many true Ribs are jointed. Its lower end terminates in a Gri≈øtle even in old Hor≈øes, who≈øe end is of a more obtu≈øe or blunt ≈øhape than in Men, in whom it is called <hi>Cartilago en≈øiformis,</hi> or the Sword-point-like Gri≈øtle.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>u≈øe</hi> is for the articulation of one end of the Collar-bones and true Ribs into it, and to ≈øerve as a Brea≈øt-plate for the ≈øafeguard and defence of the noble Bowels (<hi>viz.</hi> the Heart and Lungs) that are lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Shoulder-blade</hi> is called in Latin <hi>Scapula.</hi> There are two of them (<hi>viz.</hi> on each ≈øide of the upper part of the Che≈øt one) as there are of all the ≈øorts of Bones in the fore and al≈øo in the hinder Legs; but we ≈øhall for brevity's ≈øake ≈øpeak of the Bones onely of one Leg before and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, becau≈øe the other two are in all things like unto the≈øe, wherefore it is not any way nece≈ø≈øary to repeat the de≈øcription of them, nor yet to ≈øpeak of them in the plural number.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Shoulder-blade</hi> is ≈øeated upon the ≈øide of the true Ribs, (like a Target) reaching from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back almo≈øt to the bottom of the Collar-bone. It is in figure after a ≈øort triangular, on the in≈øide concave or hollow, and on the out≈øide prominent or arched. It is jointed to no Bone but by its lower end to the Shoulder-bone; but yet it is knit to ≈øeveral Parts by the Mu≈øcles that are in≈øerted into it, or ri≈øe from it; as to the hinder-part of the Head by the Cucullar Mu≈øcles, being the fir≈øt of its movers; al≈øo to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck by its ≈øecond pair; and to the Back by the Mu≈øcle <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>It hath three <hi>Proce≈ø≈øes.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> being the ≈øhorte≈øt, is called its <hi>Neck,</hi> which neck ends into a ≈øinuated or hollow cup or head, which receiveth the head of the Shoulder-bone, and its brim is compa≈ø≈øed with a thick
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57416:154"/>Gri≈øtle, whereby its Cavity is made the deeper that the head of the Shoulder-bone that is jointed into it ≈øhould not ≈øo ea≈øily ≈ølip out. The <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Proce≈øs, which by ≈øome is accounted the fir≈øt, is extended along its middle on the out≈øide, and is called its <hi>Spine;</hi> and that end of this Spine that by a ≈øhallow Sinus receives one of the Heads of the Shoulder-bone, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Acromium,</hi> that is to ≈øay, its point or tip. The third and la≈øt of the≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes is toward the lower and in≈øide of the Bone, and from the likene≈øs it hath with an Anchor is called <hi>Ancyroides,</hi> Anchor-like; ≈øome al≈øo who compare it to a Crows Bill, do give it the name of <hi>Coracoides:</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs doth ≈øomewhat help to hold the Shoulder-bone in its place, entring a little into a ≈øhallow <hi>Sinus</hi> of the ≈øaid Bone.</p>
                        <p>It hath five Appendixes about its Neck, three of which do afford an original to ≈øome Mu≈øcles, and from the other two do ≈øpring Ligaments which join the Shoulder-bone to the head of the Blade.</p>
                        <p>By means of the ≈øecond Proce≈øs that runs like a Ridge or Spine along the middle of its back there are formed on its out≈øide two long Furrows or <hi>Cavities,</hi> in which ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles lie, e≈øpecially the <hi>Supra≈øcapularis</hi> and <hi>Sub≈øcapularis,</hi> which are otherwi≈øe called <hi>Supra≈øpinatus</hi> and <hi>Infra≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> from their being placed the fir≈øt above this Spine or on that ≈øide next the Neck, and the latter below it or on that ≈øide next the Ribs.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> or Shoulder-bone, and the next Bone under it called the Cubit.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Bones of the Fore-leg. 1 The Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone. What Bones it articulates with. 2 The Cubit-bone, its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulations.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Bones of the <hi>Fore-leg</hi> under the <hi>Scapula</hi> or Shoulder-blade are the Shoulder-bone, the Cubit-bone, the Seven O≈ø≈øelets or little Bones that make the Knee, an≈øwering to the eight little Bones that make the <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wri≈øt in Humane Bodies, the Shank-bone an≈øwering to the Bones of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> or back of the Hand, the great Pa≈øtern an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the fir≈øt Joint of the Fingers, the little Pa≈øtern to the ≈øecond Joint, and the Coffin-bone to the la≈øt Joint, on which the Nail grows, as doth the Hoof of the Hor≈øe on the Coffin-bone. Of the ≈øimilitude there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the≈øe ≈øeveral Joints in a Hor≈øe's Fore-leg, and tho≈øe in the Arm and Hand of a Man, I have already di≈øcour≈øed pretty fully in the Book of the Mu≈øcles, where I treated of the Mu≈øcles of the≈øe Parts: wherefore I ≈øhall in this place ≈øpeak no more of that, but proceed to the de≈øcription of the before-named Bones in their order.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Shoulder-bone</hi> is that which reaches from the Shoulder-blade to the Elbow. Both its ends are called Heads, being thicker than the re≈øt of the Bone, the upper of which that is in≈øerted into the cup of the Blade-bone, is naturally an appendix to the Bone, but in time grows to be a part or proce≈øs of the Bone it ≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>This Head is large and orbicular, covered over with a Gri≈øtle, that it might be turned more glibly within the cavity of the Cup of the Blade. On the out≈øide of this Head there bunch out two rough and uneven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øes, into which two Ligaments are in≈øerted for the ≈øtrengthning of the Joint; (one of which is like a ≈øecond Head, and is articulated into the ≈øhallow cavity of the <hi>acromium,</hi> or end of the Spine of the Shoulder-bone;) and betwixt the≈øe two Proce≈ø≈øes there is a long and round chink
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57416:156"/>through which the nervous Head of the Mu≈øcle <hi>Biceps</hi> doth pa≈øs. There is al≈øo on the in≈øide another round Cavity in the ≈øide of the Head, out of which the ≈øtrong Ligament ≈øprings that ties this Head in the cup of the <hi>Scapula.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The lower Head of this Bone which in Men is articulated with two Bones, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lna</hi> and <hi>Radius,</hi> in a Hor≈øe is jointed but with one, (which I call the Cubit-bone) yet is ≈øo jointed to that one, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it and is received by it, having three Proce≈ø≈øes, and two <hi>Sinus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, much like the ≈øame Proce≈ø≈øes and <hi>Sinus</hi> in the ≈øame Bone of a Man.</p>
                        <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes already mentioned, it hath on its in≈øide another notable one, from which ari≈øe the Mu≈øcles that lie on the in≈øide of the Leg upon the Cubit-bone: and on its out≈øide it hath yet another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs, but ≈øomething le≈øs than the former, from whence do ari≈øe the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that lie on the out≈øide of the Leg upon the Cubit-bone. About the middle of this Bone, on its in≈øide, may be perceived a hole, through which both Veins and Arteries pa≈øs to the Marrow contained in this Bone, for its nouri≈øhment.</p>
                        <p>The next part of the Leg is called the <hi>Cubit,</hi> con≈øi≈øting, as hath been ≈øaid, in Men of two Bones, but in a Hor≈øe onely of one: The two Bones in Men reach from the Elbow to the Wri≈øt; and this one in Hor≈øes from the Elbow to that Joint commonly called the Knee, but which might properly enough have the ≈øame name as in Men, ≈øeeing it is of a like fabrick. This Cubit-bone in its hinder and upper part hath a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proce≈øs, long and round, onely ≈øomething flatti≈øh, which entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the larger <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavity of the lower Head of the Shoulder-bone, and maketh that bunching-out which we call the Elbow. This Proce≈øs is ≈øomething rough and uneven, partly that the Ligaments might be the more ≈øtrongly knit to it that encompa≈øs the Joint; and partly for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion of ≈øome Mu≈øcles of the Cubit, as al≈øo to give original unto the Mu≈øcles that bend the lower part of the Leg and Foot; for which cau≈øe al≈øo the Bone it ≈øelf is rough at the root of the Proce≈øs. The circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Sinus</hi> into which it is in≈øerted, is al≈øo rough, that from thence Ligaments might i≈ø≈øue. Its le≈ø≈øer and inner Proce≈øs is received by the le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Head of the Shoulder-bone. There are three cavities in this upper Head, for the reception of as many Proce≈ø≈øes of the lower end of the Shoulder-bone. Its lower end articulates with the three upper lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Bones of the Knee (that make the fir≈øt range) as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed in the next Chapter.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the ≈øeven O≈ø≈øeletts or little Bones of the Knee, of the Shank-bones which reach from the Knee to the great Pa≈øtern, and al≈øo of the two Pa≈øtern-bones and the Coffin-bone.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The number of the little Bones of the Knee. 1 The upper rank. 2 The lower. The Shank-bone, its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation. The Splent-bones. The great Pa≈øtern. The little Pa≈øtern. The Coffin-bone. Its figure, ≈øub≈øtance and Sinus's. The cau≈øe and cure of a Founder.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BEtween the Cubit-bone and the Shank-bone there are two ranges of little Bones, one above another, being in number ≈øeven, that is to ≈øay, three in the fir≈øt and four in the ≈øecond range: all which are joined one to another ≈øo firmly, that they are not ea≈øily to be ≈øeparated. The upper range are articulated with the lower end of the Cubit-bone, and the lower range with the upper end of the Shank-bone.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Bones do differ one from another in their magnitude, form and ≈øituation, and are ≈øaid in their fir≈øt generation to be all Gri≈øtles and not Bones, but in proce≈øs of time they become hard and grow bony. Their ≈øub≈øtance is ≈øpongy, as are all the re≈øt of the Bones which of Gri≈øtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bony, of which kind are all the Appendices of Bones, the Bones of the Brea≈øt and ≈øuch like. They are all covered over with both a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and gri≈øtly Ligament, whereby they are ≈øo compacted together, that without dividing the ≈øaid Ligaments, and ≈øeparating the Membranes or Skins, it is a hard matter to di≈øtingui≈øh them one from another, ≈øo that at the fir≈øt view they may be thought to be all of them but one Bone.</p>
                        <p>They have a double <hi>Superficies,</hi> one outer, which is gibbous or bunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another inward which is concavous or hollow; and in their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part where they join to the Cubit-bone, they are ≈ømooth and cru≈øted over with the before-mentioned Gri≈øtle.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Bones I will not undertake to give proper names to, but ≈øhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh them by their order and number, calling that the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> that is placed on the in≈øide of the <hi>upper</hi> rank. This is ≈øomething longi≈øh and curved inward, articulated with the Cubit-bone above, and below with the ≈øecond Bone of the lower rank, yea it toucheth both the third and fourth of the ≈øame rank. Its in≈øide joineth clo≈øely to the in≈øide of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bone of its own rank.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the≈øe Bones is clo≈øe knit to the former, being ≈øomething le≈øs than it. It is joined to the Cubit-bone in its upper part, which part is hollowed to receive the Appendix of the ≈øaid Bone. It is al≈øo joined with the fir≈øt Bone by one ≈øide, and by the other or rather hinder part to the third Bone, and la≈øtly by its bottom to the ≈øeventh Bone or fourth of the lower rank.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is al≈øo joined above with a plain Super≈øicies to the Cubit-bone, by its in≈øide to the ≈øecond Bone of its own rank, and by its lower part to the fourth Bone of the next rank.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Bone or <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the <hi>lower</hi> rank, is ≈øomething ≈ømaller than any of the before-mentioned three, and is in ≈øhape almo≈øt round. It is ≈ømooth, not being hollow nor protuberated as the re≈øt are. It is joined
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57416:157"/>above to the out≈øide of the lower-part of the fir≈øt Bone, below to the Shank-bone, and on its in≈øide to the fifth Bone or ≈øecond of its own rank.</p>
                        <p>The fifth (or <hi>≈øecond</hi> of the lower rank) hath ≈øeveral little <hi>Sinus's;</hi> It hath one notable one above into which the fir≈øt Bone of the upper rank is articulated, and another below for the reception of part of the Head of the Shank-bone.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øixth (or <hi>third</hi> of the lower rank) is joined with a plain Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on each ≈øide to the ≈øeventh (or <hi>fourth</hi>) and to the foregoing; above, to the ≈øecond, and below to the Shank-bone.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øeventh (or <hi>fourth</hi> of the lower rank) is not much unlike the former, on its in≈øide being joined to the foregoing, on its upper ≈øide to the third of the upper rank, and on its lower to the head or top of the Shank-bone.</p>
                        <p>The next part of the Leg which an≈øwers to the <hi>After-wri≈øt</hi> or back of the Hand in a Man, is made of three Bones, one of which is long and round and much larger than the other two. It reaches from the Knee to the great Pa≈øtern, being articulated above with every one of the lower rank of the little Bones of the Knee; and below it is joined to the great Pa≈øtern by a mutual articulation, having two round heads and three ≈ømall Cavities at that end of it for that purpo≈øe. This we call the <hi>Shank-bone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To each ≈øide of this Bone is fa≈øtned another long thin Bone, in figure ≈øomething like a Bodkin, being ≈øomewhat thick and round at their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, and from thence as they run down towards the Foot, becoming thinner and ≈øharper, till at la≈øt they end in a ≈øharp point, a little above the joining of the Shank-bone with the great Pa≈øtern. Between the≈øe two Bones do run the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles that move the Foot, as they de≈øcend down the Shank-bone. The≈øe two we may call the <hi>Splent-bones,</hi> ≈øtanding on each ≈øide of the Shank-bone like two Splents, ≈øuch as Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetters u≈øe for broken Bones.</p>
                        <p>The next is the Bone which an≈øwereth to the fir≈øt joint of the Fingers in Man, in whom they are five in number, by the wonderfull wi≈øedom of the Creator ≈øo ordained as was fitte≈øt for that variety of motions to which they are de≈øign'd. But an Hor≈øe being <hi>Solidipes</hi> or a whole-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature, hath all his Foot nece≈ø≈øarily moved together, and the Bones thereof in each Joint being ≈øingle, an≈øwer but to the Bones of one Finger.</p>
                        <p>The form of this Bone, which is called the <hi>great Pa≈øtern,</hi> is gibbous and crooked. At its top, where it is articulated with the Shank-bone, it has three ≈ømall Proce≈ø≈øes and two Cavities betwixt them: al≈øo two ≈ømall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Bones fa≈øtned to its back-part. Its out≈øide is plain and ≈ømooth, and without any roughne≈øs at all. Its lower end con≈øi≈øts of two heads which are round and bunching and are articulated into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>le≈ø≈øer Pa≈øtern</hi> which is under it.</p>
                        <p>The next is the <hi>little Pa≈øtern,</hi> an≈øwering to the ≈øecond Joint of the Fingers. This is not much unlike the former, onely it differs in the length, for it is not much above half ≈øo long. Its upper end (as was ≈øaid) is articulated with the great Pa≈øtern, and its lower end is received by the Coffin-bone in the ≈øame manner as it ≈øelf received the lower end of the great Pa≈øtern by its own upper end.</p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:57416:158"/>
                        <p> The next and la≈øt Bone of the Foot is the <hi>Coffin-bone,</hi> ≈øo called (I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe) from its hollowne≈øs on its under-≈øide. Its <hi>figure</hi> is ≈øemilunary or Half-moon-fa≈øhioned. It is thick at its top, (where it has cavities to receive the heads of the lower end of the little Pa≈øtern) but thin and broad at its bottom and toward its edges, for its more firm fixing upon the ground. Its <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> is fungous or ≈øpongy, having innumerable little holes piercing through its ≈øides for the pa≈ø≈øage of the Ve≈ø≈øels; as al≈øo very many ≈ømall <hi>Sinus's</hi> whereinto are implanted the ends of the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles that move the lower part of the Leg, and the Foot: who≈øe Fibres being at any time affected either by brui≈øes, ill ≈øhooing, or by ≈øtanding in the water after hard riding whil≈øt the Hor≈øe is hot, or but by ≈øtanding ≈øtill in the Stable for ≈øeveral days without having the Feet ≈øtopt up, and the like; I ≈øay the tendinous Fibres being affected by the≈øe or other means, cau≈øe the Hor≈øe to have ≈øuch great pain in his Feet, that he can ≈øcarce endure to tread upon them; which lamene≈øs we call a <hi>Founder.</hi> Now this di≈øtemper is ≈øo much the harder to cure by rea≈øon the≈øe Fibres lie ≈øo far out of reach, mo≈øt of them running on the upper ≈øide of the Bone (betwixt it and the Hoof) and not to its bottom; ≈øo that the Hoof growing upon the ≈øides as the Soal doth at the bottom, there is great hazard but we ≈øhall mi≈øs of effecting a cure, if we onely pull the Soal out, and do not cut part of the Hoof off al≈øo. This is not my bare opinion, but the experience of tho≈øe that have had good ≈øucce≈øs in curing foundred Hor≈øes, who by ra≈øing the Hoof from the Coronet or top of it to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bottom, in five or ≈øix places, untill they have made the Bloud come, and then applying their remedies to tho≈øe places, have made tho≈øe Hor≈øes ≈øound, whom the drawing out of their Soals would not cure.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> or holy Bone, together with the <hi>Coccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> or Rump-bones, otherwi≈øe called the Bones of the Dock or Tail.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Os ≈øacrum, its ≈øeat, connexion, ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Its Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae. Its Holes. The Rump-bones.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Os ≈øacrum</hi> or holy Bone, is ≈øeated at the lower end of the Back, at the end of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, to the la≈øt of which one end of it is articulated, and the other end to the fir≈øt of the Bones of the Dock or Rump-bones. It is much the broade≈øt and large≈øt of all the Bones of the Back. Its <hi>figure</hi> is almo≈øt triangular, having a broad beginning, and ending by degrees into a narrowne≈øs. On the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide it is ≈ømooth and hollow, but ≈øomething unequal; behind or on its out≈øide it is gibbous and al≈øo rough, becau≈øe of the Mu≈øcles of the Back and their Ligaments cleaving unto it. Its <hi>acute</hi> Proce≈ø≈øes or Spines are very ≈ømall; and the <hi>tran≈øver≈øe</hi> ones but ob≈øcure: as for the <hi>oblique,</hi> there is no appearance of <hi>them,</hi> ≈øave in the fir≈øt <hi>Vertebra.</hi> On its outer ≈øide near its edges there are certain <hi>Sinus's</hi> or hollowne≈ø≈øes, to which the Haunch-bones do cleave firmly by an intervening Cartilage.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are in number ≈øix, who≈øe Spines are much le≈øs than the Spines of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, and the lower or nearer to the Rump-bones, the le≈ø≈øer they are ≈øtill.</p>
                        <p>This holy Bone is perforated in ≈øeveral places; as fir≈øt, quite through its length it hath a large hole or cavity to receive the Spinal Marrow; out from which there go many other le≈ø≈øer for the egre≈øs of the Nerves;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57416:161"/>and the≈øe are not in the ≈øides of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> as tho≈øe are that be in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, Back and Loins, but on the in≈øide and out≈øide or and above, of which tho≈øe below are much the larger.</p>
                        <p>To this Bone at its lower end are joined the <hi>Rump-bones,</hi> which in this Animal we are treating of are in number eighteen. The≈øe are joined to each other by a Cartilage or Gri≈øtle, but ≈øo loo≈øely, that the Hor≈øe can bend his Rump which way he will. Tho≈øe of the≈øe Bones that are next to the holy Bone, are ≈øomething thicker and broader, than tho≈øe further from it; for as they de≈øcend down, they each grow le≈øs and le≈øs, ≈øo that the lowe≈øt grows into a cartilaginous or gri≈øtly point, as you may ≈øee in the figure of the Skeleton, where they are all lively repre≈øented <hi>in ≈øitu.</hi> The≈øe Bones are not ≈øo hard as mo≈øt of the other Bones are, but more ≈øoft and ≈øpongy; neither have they any Proce≈øs, or any hollowne≈øs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the fir≈øt of them, which hath a ≈ømall cavity or den to receive the la≈øt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> which <hi>Vertebra,</hi> is the furthe≈øt part whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spinal Marrow reaches.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the namele≈øs Bone, commonly divided into the Hip, Haunch and Share-bones.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Os innomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, or namele≈øs Bone. 1 Os ilium or Haunch-bone. Its Spine. 2 Coxendix or Hip-bone. 3 Os pubis or Share-bone. Pelvis or the Ba≈øon.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Hip-bone</hi> (commonly ≈øo called) is by Anatomi≈øts divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts. Fir≈øt, <hi>Os ilium,</hi> ≈øo named becau≈øe the Gut <hi>Ilium</hi> lieth under it. The next is called <hi>Os coxendicis,</hi> or <hi>I≈øchium,</hi> which is the lower and outer part of the namele≈øs Bone, (or <hi>Os innominatum</hi>) which is the name of the≈øe three Bones as joined all together, for they are truly but one Bone in old Hor≈øes, though in Colts they are divided one from another by Cartilages, from whence this di≈øtinction is made, and they come to be di≈øcour≈øed of by three ≈øeveral names. The third part of this Bone is called <hi>Os pubis,</hi> al≈øo <hi>Pectinis,</hi> or the Share-bone.</p>
                        <p>That part that is called <hi>Os ilium,</hi> is the uppermo≈øt and broade≈øt, which is joined to the holy Bone. In figure it is ≈øemicircular, and its ≈øemicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumference is called its Spine. On its out≈øide it is ≈øomething arched, but within hollow; the arched part is called <hi>dor≈øum,</hi> its Back, the hollow part <hi>co≈øta,</hi> or its Rib.</p>
                        <p>That part which is called its <hi>Spine,</hi> is in many places unequal, that ≈øome Mu≈øcles might take their original from it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oblique a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mu≈øcle of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Paunch, the <hi>Deltoides</hi> of the Thigh, the fir≈øt Extender of the Leg called <hi>Membrano≈øus,</hi> &amp;c. And on the back of this Bone there are unequal in≈øcriptions or lines for the ri≈øe of the three Mu≈øcles of the Thigh that help to make the Buttocks (called <hi>Glutaei;</hi>) and al≈øo for other Mu≈øcles that lie under the≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øecond of the parts of this namele≈øs Bone is called <hi>Os coxendicis.</hi>This is the lower and outer part of it, in which there is a great <hi>Sinus,</hi> called <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> the Cup or Sawcer, into which the head of the Thigh-bone is exceeding ≈øtrongly articulated. This Cup has its edges environed with a Gri≈øtle, called <hi>Supercilium,</hi> its brow; in who≈øe circumference there are ob≈øerved three <hi>Sinus,</hi> two Protuberations and an acute Proce≈øs, and la≈øtly an Appendix that is very thick: all which were ordained for the production partly of Ligaments and partly of Mu≈øcles.</p>
                        <p>The third and la≈øt part of this namele≈øs Bone is called <hi>Os pubis,</hi> or the Share-bone. This is originally two Bones, parted one from another in the middle with a Gri≈øtle, but in continuance of time the Gri≈øtle it ≈øelf becomes bony, and ≈øo unites them into one Bone. It is placed at the bottom of the Paunch, betwixt the two hinder Legs as the Hor≈øe ≈øtands. On its out≈øide it has on each ≈øide a <hi>Sinus</hi> for the de≈øcent of the crural Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels. On the ≈øame ≈øide al≈øo it is rough to give the firmer original to the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and to the ≈øecond Bender of the Leg. It is but a thin Bone, being hollow within, and perforated with the greate≈øt hole of any ≈øuch-like Bone in the whole Body. On its hinder and inner ≈øide it has two Proce≈ø≈øes, from whence the nervous bodies of the Yard, and ≈øome Mu≈øcles take their original.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Bones with the holy Bone do make that cavity which is called <hi>the Ba≈øon,</hi> which is the place wherein are contained part of the Guts, and the Bladder in a Hor≈øe; and in a Mare part of the Guts, the Bladder and the Womb.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Thigh-bone and <hi>Patella</hi> or little Bone of the Stifle.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Thigh-bone. Its upper Head. Its Neck Its lower Head is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two. Their Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Patella.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE <hi>Thigh</hi> is called by the Latins <hi>Femur √† ferendo</hi> to bear, becau≈øe the Creature is born up or ≈øu≈øtained by it. This Bone (like the Bone of the Shoulder) is but one, reaching from the Hip-bone to the Stifle. The <hi>figure</hi> of it is long, round and ≈øtreight, except where its Heads and Protuberances bunch out; of which it hath, above, one Head, one Neck, and two Proce≈ø≈øes; and below, it determins into a Head which hath two Productions and a Cavity between them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>upper Head</hi> is an orbicular Appendix ≈øtanding upon the Neck, and is the thicke≈øt and large≈øt Head of any Bone in the whole Body. It is round and long the better to enter into the Cup of the Hip-bone, which is not onely deep of it ≈øelf, but rendred deeper by a large Gri≈øtle that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øeth the edges thereof. For it was nece≈ø≈øary that a very firm articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ≈øhould be in this place, becau≈øe of the huge weight which the Thigh was to ≈øu≈øtain. And be≈øides, to ≈øtrengthen it the more, and to fa≈øten the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57416:165"/>two Bones the firmer together, there ari≈øeth out of the Cup of the Hip-bone an exceeding ≈øtrong and round Ligament, which is implanted into a little <hi>Sinus</hi> that is in the Head of the Thigh-bone. This Head is ≈ømooth and cru≈øted over with a Gri≈øtle, that it might move the more glibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cup.</p>
                        <p>The ≈ølender part under this Head is called the <hi>Neck</hi> of the Thigh-bone.This is pretty long and oblique, reaching upward but inclining inward, and is a Proce≈øs of the Bone. At its lower end, where the Bone grows broader, do ari≈øe two other Proce≈ø≈øes, called Trochanters or <hi>Rotatores,</hi> from the Mu≈øcles of that name that are in≈øerted into them. The upper of the≈øe Proce≈ø≈øes is greater than the lower, nay greater indeed than any Proce≈øs in the whole Body which is not joined to another Bone; It bends upward and outward; but the other which is much le≈øs than this, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backward and ≈øomewhat inward.</p>
                        <p>The Thigh-bone below its middle becometh thicker, and its lower end terminateth into an ample and broad Head; out of the back≈øide of which are produced two Proce≈ø≈øes, as it were two other Heads, betwixt which there is a large ≈øpace left about two inches wide, which receiveth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberation or ≈øwelling of the Head of the Leg-bone.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe two Heads at the lower end of the Thigh-bone are on their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides rough, but their in≈øides are covered with a Gri≈øtle, and thereby are made ≈ømooth and ≈ølippery for the more ea≈øy motion of the Joint. One of the≈øe Heads is thicker, and is ≈øeated inward; the other is thinner but broader, and is ≈øeated outward. From them do ≈øome of the Mu≈øcles that move the Leg ari≈øe; and into them are ≈øome that move the Thigh in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The ≈øides of the≈øe Heads are full of little holes, out of which do i≈ø≈øue the roots of the Ligaments which ≈øtrengthen the Stifle-joint.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Heads have al≈øo four <hi>Cavities,</hi> two of which are in the middle between the two Heads, and one on the out≈øide of either of them. One of the middle Cavities, being the foremo≈øt, is made to receive the protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of the <hi>Patella</hi> or Pan, and is therefore cru≈øted over with a Gri≈øtle for that purpo≈øe. The ≈øecond of the middle Cavities being more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is deeper than the other, al≈øo rough and unequal, made to receive the protuberation of the Leg-bone. The third is at the out≈øide of the outer head, and the fourth at the out≈øide of the inner, through both which the Tendons of ≈øeveral Mu≈øcles of the Leg de≈øcend.</p>
                        <p>At the lower end of this Thigh-bone, betwixt it and the Head of the Leg-bone, on the fore-≈øide, is placed a ≈ømall roundi≈øh Bone, (called the <hi>Patella</hi> or Stifle-pan) about three inches broad, being plain without, but within bunching, bored through with many ≈ømall holes. It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over on its in≈øide with a Gri≈øtle, and is made firm in its place by the broad Tendons of the ≈øecond, third and fourth Mu≈øcles that extend the Leg, to which the <hi>Patella</hi> is very firmly knit. This Bone ≈øtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the jointing of the Thigh-bone with the Leg-bone, and hindreth their di≈ølocation forwards.</p>

                        <head>
                           <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Leg-bone and Ranges of O≈ø≈øelets which make that part we call the Hock, an≈øwering to the Heel of a Man.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>The Shank-bone is but one. Its figure. Its upper Head. Its lower Head. Its Sinus's and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. Its Cavity. The ≈øeven little Bones of the Hock. The In≈øtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. The Pa≈øtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones and Coffin-bone.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THERE is the ≈øame difference between the hinder Legs of an Hor≈øe and a Man's Legs, as we ≈øhew'd above to be between the Fore-legs of an Hor≈øe and a Man's Arm. For as in Man there are two Bones which reach from the Elbow to the Wri≈øt, and but one Bone in that Joint of an Hor≈øe's Fore-leg that an≈øwers to this (reaching from his Elbow to that Joint we commonly call the Knee;) ≈øo whereas in a Man's Leg there are two Bones, called <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula;</hi> in the ≈øame Joint of an Hor≈øe that reaches from the Stifle to the Heel, there is but one, which we ≈øhall call by the name of <hi>Tibia,</hi> or the Shin or Shank-bone, becau≈øe the Bone of a Man's Leg that goes by that name, is the more con≈øiderable of the two.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of this Bone is long, and <hi>round</hi> in an Hor≈øe, but in a Man it is three-≈øquare. The upper part of it which joins with the Thigh-bone, is broader and thicker than the lower.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>upper Head</hi> in which are two cavities and a prominence betwixt them, is cru≈øted over with a Gri≈øtle, and both receives and is received by the two Heads and cavity of the Thigh-bone; which Gri≈øtle is fa≈øtned to it by Ligaments. This Gri≈øtle is ≈ølippery and ≈ømooth, and the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it lines are full of an unctuous or oily matter or humour, which ≈øerves to further the motion of the Joint by rendring it moi≈øt and ≈ølippery.</p>
                        <p>The lower part of this Bone, or its lower Head, is round and likewi≈øe covered with a Gri≈øtle, with which it is made ≈øomething broad, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding equals not the largene≈øs of the upper Head.</p>
                        <p>This Bone hath ≈øeveral <hi>Sinus's</hi> and <hi>Appendices,</hi> as well as the Thigh-bone hath; the former for conveniency of the Tendons of ≈øome Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to de≈øcend by, and the latter for the ri≈øe or original of other Mu≈øcles which are to move the Foot.</p>
                        <p>This Bone as well as the Thigh-bone (and mo≈øt other Bones) is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hollowed within, having its cavity filled with Marrow. It is al≈øo perforated in ≈øeveral places, admitting through its perforations ≈øeveral Ve≈ø≈øels to the ≈øaid Marrow.</p>
                        <p>Next come we to the little Bones of the <hi>Hock,</hi> which Joint an≈øwereth to the In≈øtep and Heel of a Man. The≈øe are of the ≈øame number as tho≈øe of the Knee in the Fore-legs were, and do al≈øo lie in two ranges, the one above the other, <hi>viz.</hi> three in the upper, and four in the lower. The≈øe Bones, as tho≈øe in the Knee, are ≈øo clo≈øely articulated one with another, and ≈øo clo≈øely wrapt up and bound together with membranous Ligaments, that it is not ea≈øie for the Di≈ø≈øector to di≈øcover where all of them are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: ≈øo that without diligent in≈øpection they may be taken to be not above half the number they are truly of.</p>
                        <p>To treat of every particular Bone of them and of their connexion one with another, or la≈øtly of their jointing with the Shank-bone above, or with the three Bones of the <hi>Metatar≈øus</hi> below, would be in a manner the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57416:166"/>repeating of the ≈øame de≈øcription over again that we gave above of the ≈øeven little Bones of the Knee. Onely that which is the hindmo≈øt and large≈øt of them de≈øerves to have particular notice taken of it, and that is it which is truly, and ought to be called the Heel-bone, who≈øe ≈øhape and po≈øture you may ≈øee in the following Figure. Into this Bone it is that ≈øeveral of the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles that bend the Leg are in≈øerted. On its in≈øide it has a large <hi>Sinus</hi> by which the Tendons of tho≈øe Mu≈øcles that move the lower Parts of the Foot do de≈øcend, as al≈øo the larger Ve≈ø≈øels thereof.</p>
                        <p>The next Bones to the≈øe are the three that an≈øwer to tho≈øe five that make that part of the Foot in Humane Bodies which is called the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar≈øus</hi> or In≈øtep. The≈øe I ≈øay are but three in a Hor≈øe, though in a Man they are five, to an≈øwer to the number of the five Toes. They reach from the lower range of the little Bones of the Hock before-mentioned, down to the great Pa≈øtern. One of them is a large, long and round Bone; the other two are much more ≈ølender, and ≈øhorter, being the one of them placed on the in≈øide and the other on the out≈øide of it, adhering ≈øo clo≈øely thereunto, that they are not ea≈øily to be ≈øeparated from it. The≈øe little Bones an≈øwer in all things to the like Bones which run down by the ≈øides of the Shank-bone of the Fore-legs, which from their ≈øhape I called the Bodkin-like Bones, (as likewi≈øe the Splent-bones, becau≈øe they ≈øtand by the ≈øides of the middle great Bone, like the Splents that Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetters make u≈øe of for ≈øtrengthning broken Bones till they are knit again;) I ≈øay the≈øe are like tho≈øe, and therefore may be called by the ≈øame names.</p>
                        <p>The remaining part of the Bones of the hinder Leg and Foot are the great Pa≈øtern (with the two little triangular Bones adhering to the top of it,) the little Pa≈øtern, and the Coffin-bone; of all which having already treated where I de≈øcribed the Bones of the Fore-legs, (with which the≈øe of the Hinder-legs agree in every particular) I ≈øhall for brevitie's ≈øake omit ≈øpeaking particularly of them, and here conclude my di≈øcour≈øe of the Bones.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Hoofs of an Hor≈øe an≈øwering to the Nails of a Man's Fingers or Toes.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>How the Hoofs are nouri≈øhed, and how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtened upon the Foot.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>COncerning the Nails of a Man's Fingers and Toes (to which the Hoofs of Hor≈øes bear a re≈øemblance) learned Men are divided into ≈øeveral opinions about their generation. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is affirmed to be of opinion, that they are made of a glutinous matter or moi≈øture parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dried by heat, and driven to the extreme parts. <hi>Empedocles</hi> thinks them to be made of the extremities of the Nerves, calling them <hi>Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum clau≈øulas ≈øummas,</hi> the utmo≈øt terminations or boundaries of the Nerves; and that therefore when the≈øe fall off, it is a ≈øign of great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> in lib. 2. cap. 6. <hi>de generatione Animal.</hi> ≈øaith, that the Nails, Hairs, Beaks of Birds, Hoofs of Bea≈øts, and ≈øuch like, are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of <hi>adventitious</hi> aliment. And la≈øtly, <hi>Columbus</hi> thinks they take their original partly from the Skin, and partly from the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles which move the Fingers and Toes, and that they are encrea≈øed like the Teeth by an appo≈øition of aliment to their root.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Hoofs</hi> of Hor≈øes, whatever be their original matter, out of which they are formed, their growth ≈øeems to be (according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the la≈øt mentioned Authour) from the addition of new particles to their roots, which drive down ≈øucce≈ø≈øively tho≈øe before them. They are of a middle ≈øub≈øtance betwixt Bones and Gri≈øtles: not ≈øo hard as Bones, for then they would be apt to ≈øplinter and break; nor ≈øo ≈øoft as Gri≈øtles, for if they were, they could not ≈øupport ≈øo great a bulk as
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57416:168"/>the Body of an Hor≈øe, much le≈øs endure to travel among≈øt ≈øtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they are of a horney ≈øub≈øtance, without ≈øen≈øe, growing pretty firmly to the parts included within them, and fa≈øtened to the Coffin-bone by a Ligament that proceeds from their top or root, which root the Skin al≈øo ≈øomewhat encompa≈ø≈øeth.</p>
                        <p>Under them lie many twigs of Nerves, and Tendons of Mu≈øcles, which run even to the very bottom of the Hoof or Soal of the Foot, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pricking of which with a Nail or the like, or when they are but brui≈øed with riding in hard way, the Hor≈øe pre≈øently bemoans him≈øelf, as was more at large ≈øhewed before in the twelfth Chapter of this Book.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>A Gri≈øtle what. Their u≈øes.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS an Appendix to the hi≈øtory or doctrine of the Bones, it will not be unnece≈ø≈øary to ≈øpeak ≈øomewhat of the <hi>Cartilages</hi> or <hi>Gri≈øtles:</hi> e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ≈øeeing through the whole di≈øcour≈øe of this Fifth Book we have had occa≈øion ever and anon to mention them, but have not as yet given any particular account of them; as neither of a <hi>Ligament,</hi> which we have al≈øo often mentioned: but of this latter in the next Chapter, and onely of the <hi>Gri≈øtles</hi> in this, becau≈øe they come neare≈øt to the nature of Bones.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Cartilage</hi> is a <hi>≈øimilar part, cold and dry, made</hi> (as ≈øome Authours affirm) <hi>out of the mo≈øt glutinous part of the Seed.</hi> They are ≈ølexible and without ≈øen≈øe, and are much ≈øofter than a Bone, though the nature of the one is not ≈øo much di≈øtant from the other, but that ≈øeveral Gri≈øtles in tract of time, and as the Creatures grow old, harden into Bones.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the <hi>Gri≈øtles</hi> are many. For <hi>fir≈øt</hi> they help the motion of the Bones at their jointings one with another. For which end in the Joints that are ≈øubject to great motions, the edges of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> or Cups and Cavities of the Bones that articulate one with another, are generally lined with a Gri≈øtle, to make the motion more glib and ≈øecure; ≈øuch are the articulation of the Shoulder-bone with the Shoulder-blade, of the Thigh-bone with the Hip-bone, and ≈øeveral others.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>≈øecond</hi> u≈øe of the Gri≈øtles is by <hi>yielding,</hi> a little to give way to the violence of outward injuries; whereas if Bones had been in their places, they would have been in danger of breaking, from their hardne≈øs and ≈øtiffne≈øs: for which end the ends of many Bones which are expo≈øed to external injuries are furni≈øhed with Gri≈øtles, as the No≈øe and Ears, and the like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Another</hi> u≈øe of the Gri≈øtles is, that by their mediation, as it were by a glue, ≈øome Bones might be conjoined; as the Share-bones in particular are by this means united to one another.</p>
                        <p>There are many other <hi>peculiar</hi> u≈øes of particular Gri≈øtles, ≈øome belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sight, ≈øome to the Hearing, ≈øome to Smelling, ≈øome to Re≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or breathing, and the like; all which have their ≈øeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57416:168"/>But of the≈øe we have already treated as they fell in our way, when we di≈øcour≈øed of the parts to which each did belong. I ≈øhall not therefore need to inlarge any further upon them in this place.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>A Ligament what. Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Their u≈øes.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS the lubricity or ≈ølipperine≈øs of Gri≈øtles makes the motion of the Bones more ea≈øie and glib; ≈øo the <hi>Ligaments</hi> do ≈øecure that motion by ≈øtrengthning the articulation of one Bone with another.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Ligament</hi> is a <hi>≈øimilar part, cold and dry, of a middle nature betwixt a Gri≈øtle and a Membrane;</hi> harder than Membranes, le≈øt in vehement motions they ≈øhould be broken; and ≈øofter than Gri≈øtles, that they might the more ea≈øily follow and obey the Mu≈øcles which move the Bones. Tho≈øe that tie one Bone to another are generally in≈øen≈øible, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they receive no Nerves into them, as al≈øo le≈øt being perpetually moved they ≈øhould breed perpetual pain. But ≈øuch as tie other parts, as the Ligaments of the Liver, of the Womb, the bridle of the Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the≈øe are endued with ≈øen≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>differences</hi> of Ligaments are many, being taken fir≈øt from their <hi>≈øub≈øtance,</hi> whence ≈øome are ≈øaid to be hard, others ≈øoft, the former of which are called cartilaginous, and the latter membranous Ligaments. The epithet of <hi>membranous</hi> is likewi≈øe given to ≈øome from their breadth, in oppo≈øition whereto others are called <hi>nervous,</hi> becau≈øe they are round like Nerves.</p>
                        <p>They are al≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed from their <hi>original</hi> and <hi>in≈øertion;</hi> for ≈øome <hi>ari≈øe</hi> from Bones, ≈øome from Gri≈øtles, and ≈øome from Membranes; and are accordingly diver≈øly <hi>in≈øerted.</hi> And la≈øtly they are differenced from their <hi>≈øtrength</hi> and <hi>figure.</hi> To give particular in≈øtances of all which, would be a needle≈øs curio≈øity: I ≈øhall therefore break off when I have added a word of their <hi>u≈øe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>u≈øes</hi> of the Ligaments, as well as Gri≈øtles, are many: for <hi>fir≈øt</hi> they confirm and ≈øtrengthen the articulations of the Bones: they <hi>al≈øo</hi> bind and fa≈øten the Bones to one another where there is no true articulation. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they ≈øerve as an outward garment to the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which are throughout their whole length covered with Ligaments and Membranes. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they interpo≈øe like a Pillow betwixt the Bones and the Tendons of the Mu≈øcles. <hi>Fifthly</hi> and la≈øtly, ≈øome of them do ≈øerve to ≈øu≈øpend the Bowels, that they ≈øhould not fall with their great weight, ≈øuch are the Ligaments of the Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                        <p>IN the Introduction to the <hi>foregoing</hi> Anatomical Treati≈øe I premi≈øed, that my inducement to compile and publi≈øh it was to in≈øtruct tho≈øe of my own Profe≈ø≈øion in the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>u≈øe</hi> of the Parts of that Creature which is the Subject of our Art. And becau≈øe mo≈øt Farriers are Per≈øons of ≈ømall literature, I promi≈øed and intended to write the Di≈øcour≈øe in ≈øuch plain and familiar phra≈øe as they might be capable of apprehending, that they might reap that benefit from it which was de≈øigned them. (And I have as much as I could endeavoured to ≈øerve that fir≈øt intention.) But upon publi≈øhing my Propo≈øals for printing this Book, finding that it would not be unacceptable to Per≈øons of the be≈øt rank, as well of the Nobility as Gentry, I thought it advi≈øeable not to pen it in too paltry and homely a ≈øtyle, le≈øt it might be nau≈øeous and unplea≈øant to ≈øuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Per≈øons as by their Sub≈øcriptions were plea≈øed to give me encouragement to go on with the Work. So that I hope in the peru≈øal of it, it will both be delightfull to the≈øe latter ≈øort of Readers, and yet in≈øtruct and benefit the former, for whom onely (as I ≈øaid) it was at fir≈øt intended.</p>
                        <p>But now as to the <hi>following</hi> Di≈øcour≈øe which was al≈øo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Propo≈øals, I found that not onely the Men of my own Profe≈ø≈øion made ≈ømall reckoning of it; but I was cen≈øured by ≈øome of note, for pretending to treat of things above my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. I mu≈øt confe≈øs I was a little aba≈øhed and di≈øcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd at this Cen≈øure, as having but a ≈ømall ≈øhare of that confidence whereby ≈øo many recommend them≈øelves to the World: in≈øomuch as growing jealous of my own ability, I took advice upon it. And it was my good fortune to meet with a Per≈øon, that upon my imparting my thoughts to him, encouraged me to go forward, promi≈øing, if I needed any, to lend me ≈øome a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance. And I mu≈øt acknowledge that the Reader (and my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57416:171"/>≈øelf) are very <hi>much</hi> owing to his kindne≈øs for the beginning of this Treati≈øe; and <hi>partly</hi> al≈øo for the <hi>compo≈øure</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; (though the Ob≈øervations, which are the ground of the Di≈øcour≈øe, be wholly mine own:) for I dur≈øt not tru≈øt my Pen alone in what I perceived would be ≈øcan'd with ≈øome ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He that doth not under≈øtand it, may believe it was not writ for <hi>his</hi> u≈øe; and he that doth, is de≈øired to accept it in good part.</p>
                        <p>And now to give ≈øome more particular account of it:</p>
                        <p>It will not be expected that an <hi>Appendix</hi> or Supplement ≈øhould contain an Hi≈øtory of the Generation of <hi>all</hi> Animals; for that would require ≈øeveral Volumes: but it will ≈øuffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe the Generation of one <hi>Oviparous</hi> and another <hi>Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Creature (the Young of one being formed <hi>without,</hi> and the other <hi>within</hi> the Body) to which all others what≈øoever may be reduced.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Animal</hi> I under≈øtand every thing that hath ≈øen≈øe and motion. Concerning which it will not fall in my way to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of their ≈øeveral <hi>natures</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> tho≈øe con≈øiderations lying before him that would treat of Animals already perfectly generated and matured: but my province will be to ≈øhew <hi>(1)</hi> from what <hi>original matter,</hi> and <hi>(2)</hi> by what <hi>efficient cau≈øe</hi> Animals are generated, and <hi>(3)</hi> in what <hi>order</hi> and by what <hi>degrees</hi> their <hi>Parts</hi> are fir≈øt delineated, and at la≈øt come to be perfected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. The original matter of Animals.</note> Fir≈øt then as to their <hi>original matter,</hi> I affirm univer≈øally of all Animals, that it is an <hi>Egg,</hi> either formally, or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing analogous thereto, and which upon many accounts may not improperly have that appellation given it: Yea this term may be applied not onely to Animals, but to the Seeds of Plants or Herbs, and Kernels of the Fruit of Trees al≈øo. And indeed ≈øeeing the Young of every Animal in their ≈øeveral ≈øpecies arrives to a con≈øiderable bulk before it hath any Animal life, during which time it encrea≈øes and grows merely as a Vegetable; there is no ≈øuch great difference in the fir≈øt principles and manner of growth of Vegetables and Animals as is commonly conceived. And therefore to ≈øatisfy the Curious, and to lay the <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> foundation for my de≈øign, I ≈øhall in the fir≈øt place premi≈øe the manner of procedure in the vegetation of Seeds from the micro≈øcopical ob≈øervations of <hi>Malpighius</hi> in his ≈øecond Part of the Anatomy of Plants.</p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57416:171"/>
                        <p>Now that both Vegetables and Animals ≈øhould proceed from Eggs, will ≈øeem no very ≈øtrange notion to him that hath read the Saying of ≈øome old Philo≈øophers, <hi>Ex Ovo omnia,</hi> that all things are from an Egg: though I mu≈øt confe≈øs that it is not nece≈ø≈øarily to be under≈øtood in my ≈øen≈øe, but po≈ø≈øibly means no more than that the fir≈øt formation of all things was from an Egg, according to the opinion delivered by <hi>Ari≈øtophanes</hi> in his <hi>Aves,</hi> p. <hi>573.</hi> (quoted by Doctour <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his <hi>True Intellectual Sy≈øteme of the Univer≈øe,</hi> p. <hi>121.</hi>) namely that at fir≈øt there was nothing but <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Chaos,</hi> which laying an Egg, from thence was produced <hi>Love,</hi> and that mingling again with <hi>Chaos</hi> begot Heaven and Earth, and Animals, and all the Gods.

                        </q>
                        <p>I know that the term <hi>Egg</hi> is not alike properly applicable to the fir≈øt ≈øeed or principle out of which <hi>every</hi> thing is formed; but for di≈øtinction ≈øake it may ≈øeem more proper and intelligible to call ≈øuch principle by ≈øeveral names; as in Humane kind and Quadrupeds to call it a <hi>conception;</hi> in Fi≈øhes to name them <hi>Roes</hi> (though in Latin they have no other name but <hi>Ova,</hi> Eggs;) in Frogs, the <hi>Spawn;</hi> in In≈øects, as Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies, <hi>&amp;c. Worms</hi> (according to <hi>Ari≈øtotle;</hi>) as likewi≈øe in Plants to term them <hi>Seeds;</hi> in the fruits of Trees, <hi>Kernels.</hi> I ≈øay it may ≈øeem more proper to retain this vulgar way of ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rather u≈øe the≈øe ≈øundry appellations, than to confound them all under one general one: I will not therefore contend about <hi>words,</hi> but ≈øhall readily permit every man to u≈øe his own phra≈øe; onely I contend for the <hi>thing,</hi> hoping to make it

                        <p>If any think I begin too far off my ≈øcope, to treat of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of <hi>Plants,</hi> when my de≈øign is to explain the generation of <hi>Animals;</hi> be≈øides what Apology the thing it ≈øelf will make for me with every Intelligent Reader, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s Hi≈øtory of the Creation ≈øeems to authori≈øe ≈øuch a method, and to chalk out my way for me. We find the Almighty proceeding every day from the more imperfect and ignoble Creatures to the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and noble: Whence on the third day he commands <hi>the Earth to bring forth Gra≈øs, the Herb yielding Seed, and the Fruit-tree yielding Fruit after his kind, who≈øe Seed is in it ≈øelf, upon the Earth.</hi> On the fifth day he commands <hi>the Waters to bring forth abundantly the moving Creature that hath life, and Fowl that may flie above the Earth in the open Firmament of Heaven.</hi> And la≈øtly on the ≈øixth day he bids <hi>the Earth bring forth the Living Creature after his kind, Cattel and creeping thing, and Bea≈øt of the Earth after his kind:</hi> and on the ≈øame day <hi>he created Man in his own image to have dominion over the Fi≈øh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattel,</hi> &amp;c. Whether God ob≈øerved ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øive <hi>order of time</hi> in the Creation, as the holy Text de≈øcribes, or whether the Hi≈øtory be onely ≈øo delivered for our better apprehen≈øion, is too deep and bold a ≈øpeculation for me to meddle with: but it is plain that it <hi>literally</hi> accords with the <hi>nature</hi> of the things created; ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the progre≈øs is natural from Vegetation to Animality, and from thence to Rationality. For thus a Man is for ≈øome months onely a ≈øort of Vegetable, capable of increa≈øe of Parts, but without ≈øen≈øe or motion, which afterwards he comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, but without any <hi>exerci≈øe</hi> of Rea≈øon till ≈øome time after his birth. But this la≈øt con≈øideration is beyond my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, and onely mentioned to ≈øhew, that the ≈øame method <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> ob≈øerves in the Hi≈øtory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> is natural enough to follow in an Hi≈øtory of <hi>Generation.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Vegetation of Seeds, particularly of a Wheat-corn.</head>
                        <p>THE conception of an Animal and the fir≈øt formation and encrea≈øe of an Embryo in the Womb, corre≈øponds very much (as we have already hinted) to the Seed of a Plant and its vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Bo≈øom of the great and common Mother, the Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ob≈øerving in what manner a Seed proceeds to a Plant being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every Man; to give an account of ≈øuch ob≈øervation may much conduce to the better apprehending by what degrees a Conception grows to a perfect <hi>Foetus.</hi> But the parts of a Seed being ≈øo minute, that the naked Eye can make no perfect di≈øcovery of the fir≈øt rudiments of the Plant that is formed out of it, it is nece≈ø≈øary to make u≈øe of a Micro≈øcope to greaten the Objects, which the mo≈øt curious <hi>Malpighius</hi> hath done with that accuracy as to render further inquiry and examination needle≈øs. I ≈øhall therefore give you an account of his ob≈øervations of this kind in as few words and as plain as I can.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The manner of vegetation in Seeds.</note> The Eggs (or Seeds) of Plants being excluded out of the Mother's Egg-bed (called a Pod, or Husk, or by whatever other name di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed) requiring further fo≈øtering and brooding, are committed to the Earth by the officious Winds, or by the indu≈øtry of Men. This kind Mother having received them into her Bo≈øom, doth not onely give them incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or brooding by her own halituous vapours joined with the heat of the Sun-beams; but doth by degrees abundantly ≈øupply what the fruitfull Seeds ≈øtand in need of. For ≈øhe every-where abounds with little chanels or ≈øinuous pa≈ø≈øages, in which the Rain-water ≈øatiated and impregnated with fruitfull Salts does run like the Bloud and Chyle in the Arteries of Animals; which moi≈øture is tran≈øcolated or ≈øtrained through the Pores or Pipes of the outer rind or husk (corre≈øponding to the Membranes that inve≈øt the Embryo's of Animals) on the in≈øide of which lie the thick ≈øeminal Leaves, which are commonly two, (though in that which we ≈øhall in≈øtance in by and by, it is but one) that an≈øwer to the <hi>Placenta</hi> or Womb-cake in Women, or to the Cotyledons in Brutes. For the ≈øub≈øtance of the≈øe two Seed-leaves con≈øi≈øts of a great number of little bladders or bottles, and of Navel-ve≈ø≈øels, or a Navel-knot. Into the bottles is received the fruitfull moi≈øture of the Earth that is ≈øtrained through the rind of the Seed, which makes a ≈ømall fermentation with that proper juice that was inherent originally in the Seed-leaves; and this fermented Liquor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by the umbilical Ve≈ø≈øel to the Trunk of the Plant, and to the Gemm or Bud that is continued to it; whereupon a vegetation and increa≈øe of the Parts ≈øucceed.</p>
                        <p>This, in ≈øhort, is the manner of procedure in the vegetation of Plants; how far it agrees with the fir≈øt formation and encrea≈øe of the Embryo's of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57416:174"/>Animals, will be made more plain by and by. In the mean time, that what I have here ab≈øtracted out of the above-mentioned mo≈øt ingenious Authour, may be the better under≈øtood, I have thought good further to tran≈øcribe out of him an in≈øtance or example of this procedure, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the ≈øame al≈øo in a curious Figure to the Eye of the Reader that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øo well conceive of it by the bare verbal de≈øcription. My in≈øtance ≈øhall be in a grain of <hi>Wheat.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">An Hi≈øtory of the vegetation of a Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</note>
                        <q>
                           <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> day after it is ≈øown, it grows a little turgid, and the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundine or husk gapes a little in ≈øeveral places. The body of the Plant A being continuous with the conglobated Leaf, (which is called the fle≈øh of the Seed that makes the flowr) ≈øwells not onely with the Gemm or Sprout, that is, with the future Stem B, which is opened and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth green by degrees; but al≈øo the lateral Roots CC do bunch out a little; and likewi≈øe the lower Root D becoming green jets ≈øomewhat out; whence the <hi>Placenta</hi> or Seed-leaf E becomes loo≈øe and gapes. The body of the Plant is continued and knit, by the Navel-knot F, to the conglobated Flowr-leaf, which ≈øupplies matter for vegetation.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>two</hi> daies the Secundine or Husk G being broken through, the Stem, or top of the future Straw H appears on the out≈øide of it, and with its top is a little di≈øtant from the Leaf (that is continued to it) growing upward by degrees. The Seed-leaf I guarding the Roots, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes turgid with the little bladders, and puts forth a white down; this Leaf being pulled away, you may ≈øee the Roots of the Plant made bare, of which the long one K is very apparent, but the two others LL are more ob≈øcure. The top of the Stem H is crooked; and within, the Gemm or Bud and future Leaves and Stalk lie hid. Between the Roots and a≈øcending Stem, the trunk of the Plant is knit by the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knot M to the Flowr-leaf which is very moi≈øt, but as yet keeps its white colour, and its proper and natural ta≈øte.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>third</hi> day <hi>approaching,</hi> the pulp of the conglobated or round Leaf becomes turgid with the juice that it has received from the Earth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with its own genuine juice. The Plant encrea≈øes in bigne≈øs; and its Bud, or Stem N becoming taller, from whiti≈øh turns ≈øomewhat green; and the lateral Roots OO break forth greeni≈øh and pyramidal from the gaping Sheath P, which adheres clo≈øely to the Plant. The lower Root Q becomes longer and hairy, having many Fibres growing out of it. At the ≈øame time, in ≈øuch Seeds as are more quick and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the lower Root R is larger, growing green in its end, and the Side-roots ≈øprout out of the Sheath S that inve≈øted them: which Sheath ≈øwelling with white and thick bladders, is continued, like a bark, with the outer and inve≈øting ≈øub≈øtance. Abundance of hairy Fibres hang all along upon the Roots, except upon their tip: tho≈øe which grow about their ba≈øis are longer, and tho≈øe which follow, become ≈øhorter and ≈øhorter. They twirle about the ≈øaline Particles, and little lumps of Earth, like Ivy, whence they grow curled. The <hi>Placenta</hi> T fades by degrees, and above the lateral Roots SS there break out two other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones UU. The Stem X being roundi≈øh and waxed bigger grows ≈øtreight upwards.</p>
                           <p>Towards the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> day, the Stem Y tending upwards, makes as it were a right angle with the ≈øeminal Leaf Z lying horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally: it is ≈ølenderer and more longi≈øh; and its outer cover is white, and bright or tran≈øparent, guarding the tender and greeni≈øh Gem. The
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57416:174"/>la≈øt Roots <hi>a</hi> jet out more; and the other three growing larger are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a down, that ≈øtraitly embraces the lumps of Earth: this down is ≈øo luxuriant, e≈øpecially where it meets with any vacuity, that its hairs uniting with one another make a kind of net. The conglobated or Flowr-leaf Z is ≈øofter, and milky as it were; whence if one brui≈øe it, it yields a white and ≈øweeti≈øh juice like Barly-cream: if one pull the Plant from it, the Roots and Stem of the Plant are plain to be ≈øeen: al≈øo the intermediate Navel-knot <hi>b</hi> appears, who≈øe outer and inve≈øting part is more ≈øolid like bark; but the inner part is more ≈øoft and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowy.</p>
                           <p>At the end of the <hi>fourth</hi> day, the Stalk tending upwards, (the outer or Sheath-leaf <hi>c</hi> being loo≈øened) puts forth the <hi>Stable</hi>-leaf <hi>d</hi> that is green and folded. Below, the afore-de≈øcribed Roots grow longer; and there appears a new tumour (≈øometimes two,) of a future Root <hi>e.</hi> The Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf <hi>f</hi> al≈øo that hangs upon the Plant begins to fade, who≈øe remaining juice notwith≈øtanding is as yet white and uncorrupted. If one cut the Stem in≈øunder, the ri≈øe of the tender Stalk <hi>g</hi> appears to be from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-knot, from which al≈øo the Roots take their beginning: outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likewi≈øe the Sheath-leaf <hi>c</hi> is to be ≈øeen, wherein the Stalk, and its Leaves, and the ri≈øe of the Roots are infolded.</p>
                           <p>About the <hi>≈øixth</hi> day, the <hi>Stable</hi>-leaf <hi>h</hi> being loo≈øened, the Plant mounts upward, the thick Sheath-leaf <hi>i</hi> as yet cleaving about it like a bark. The Seed-leaf <hi>k</hi> on its out≈øide is ≈øinuous or full of crinkles, and faded: this being cut and freed from the husk or ≈øecundine, the Fle≈øh or <hi>Pericarpium</hi> is not alike all over; for its outer part, whereby the out≈øide of the Seed or Grain is heaved up, is more ≈øolid, and looks like a concave Leaf: it hath the ≈øame appearance al≈øo in that part whereby it ≈øticks and is continued to the Navel-knot: but its in≈øide is fi≈øtulous and fill'd with humour, e≈øpecially that part of it that is next to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-knot. The Leaves being pull'd off, the Roots torn, and the Flowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf removed, the trunk appears, in which, not far from the Roots, the Navel-knot <hi>l</hi> bunches out, which is ≈øolid, and hard to cut: above, there is the mark of the Sheath-leaf <hi>i</hi> that was pull'd off: under this, as in an Arm-pit, the Gemm <hi>m</hi> is often hid; beyond which there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe a knot, with the skar of the torn off Leaf <hi>n,</hi> and in the top the ≈øoft Gem <hi>o</hi> is kept; and thus the whole bulk of the future Stalk is had in this <hi>compendium.</hi> The hinder-part al≈øo of the Plant ≈øhews the breakings forth of the Roots; likewi≈øe the faded <hi>Placenta</hi> or Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf <hi>p,</hi> and the skar of the Sheath-leaf <hi>i,</hi> with the following Knots and Gemm <hi>o.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>After the <hi>eleventh</hi> day, the Seed-leaf <hi>q</hi> often as yet ≈øticking to the Plant, is crumpled and almo≈øt corrupted; for being opened, it yields an humour with airy bubbles: within, it is hollow, and about the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines the mucous and white ≈øub≈øtance of the Seed, being continued even to the Navel-knot, formes a cavity. All the Roots becoming lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger put forth new Branches out of their ≈øides; and the Stalk, though it have taller Leaves, yet for the mo≈øt part it is no longer than the trunk above delineated: for as yet the knots and gems being very near to one another, are not far from the Navel-knot. Sometimes, the vegetation making progre≈øs, the ≈øpaces betwixt the knots are larger; and the Sheath-leaf <hi>r</hi> being pull'd off the ≈øide, a Knot <hi>≈ø</hi> appears, out of which there ≈øprouts forth a Leaf <hi>t</hi> that fo≈øters the a≈øcending Stem. In the mean
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57416:175"/>time the ≈øeminal Leaf withers, and is emptied on its in≈øide; and if one pre≈øs it, it yields nought but Water. The white and ≈øolid internode (or ≈øpace between the Knots) is lengthned, and new Gemms appear; and the middle Root grows to be ≈øeveral inches long.</p>
                           <p>After a <hi>month,</hi> both the Roots and Stalk being grown longer, new Buds <hi>uu</hi> appear to be breaking forth of the fir≈øt Knot, and very little Tumours <hi>xx</hi> bunch out, which at length break forth into Roots: for Roots ≈øprout out ≈øo ea≈øily, that ≈øometimes if one pull off the fir≈øt Roots, there will abundance of new ones ari≈øe in their ≈øtead. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe at the ≈øame time, the Stem being e≈øtabli≈øhed with its u≈øual Roots, puts forth new ones <hi>yy</hi> which break through even the Sheath-leaf that cloaths it: and it al≈øo ri≈øes up with a white joint that is full with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Above the Roots from the ≈øame Knot grow two Buds <hi>zz,</hi> guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their proper Leaves; and the intermediate Stalk runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This Hi≈øtory it was thought good to tran≈ølate at its full length, (though there are ≈øome particulars that may ≈øeem beyond our purpo≈øe, and which are not mentioned in the general de≈øcription of Vegetation that was premi≈øed) le≈øt we ≈øhould be injurious to the mo≈øt ingenious Authour by concealing any of his di≈øcoveries. But pa≈ø≈øing by <hi>them,</hi> it will appear plainly by the following di≈øcour≈øe, how little the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Embryo and fir≈øt encrea≈øe of its Parts, differs from the fir≈øt ≈øpringing of a Vegetable; and then the Reader will further ≈øe√© how natural and rea≈øonable it was to begin with the de≈øcription of this latter, the better to explain the former.</p>

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the Yelks while they remain in the Ovary are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed and encrea≈øed by the Arterial bloud as all other Parts of the Body are; yet as ≈øoon as they are dropt off from thence, they never adhere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards or grow to any Part whereby any Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels ≈øhould be in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them: but as they make no ≈øtay in the Tunnel, ≈øo do they not adhere to the ≈øides either of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> (≈øpecially ≈øo called) or of its <hi>Proce≈øs.</hi> But there being great ≈øtore of Arteries di≈øper≈øed through them both, the≈øe ≈øpew as it were out of their ≈ømall mouths (that open into the Cavity of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> and its <hi>Proce≈øs</hi>) a great quantity of a whiti≈øh chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous liquor, which the Yelks by an innate vegetative principle attract and a≈ø≈øimilate to them≈øelves, and which con≈øtitutes their White. Now ≈øeeing (as we noted above) that the Yelks as they come from the Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have two Coats, one proper, and another borrowed; I am of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the White is collected betwixt the≈øe two; namely, that the uterine humour tran≈øudes through or is imbibed by the borrowed Coat, but is ≈øtopped from proceeding further towards the centre of the Egg by the proper Coat which is more den≈øe and clo≈øe. For the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Ovary from whence this outer Coat is borrowed, is of a loo≈øe ≈øpongy ≈øub≈øtance, whence 'tis probable the Coat is ≈øo likewi≈øe. Onely 'tis likely that ≈øome particles of this humour penetrate through the inner Coat al≈øo, by which the Yelk receives increa≈øe, and al≈øo ≈øome alteration in ≈øub≈øtance from what it was of, while it remained in the Ovary. Though I think this opinion is new, yet I am the bolder to profe≈øs it, not onely becau≈øe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57416:177"/>it cannot well be conceived how a new Coat ≈øhould be acquired in the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus,</hi> ≈øeeing the Egg adheres to no part from which it ≈øhould receive it; but much more from the Analogy there ≈øeems to be between the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of an Egg (in Hens) and that of a Conception (in Viviparous Animals.) Now every Body knows that a Conception when it is never ≈øo ≈ømall, is clad with two Coats, the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> and that the Albugineous liquor of the Womb tran≈øudes through them both for the nouri≈øhment of the Embryo contained in the <hi>Amnios.</hi> I ≈øay it pa≈ø≈øes through <hi>both</hi> the Membranes of a Conception, becau≈øe it was nece≈ø≈øary it ≈øhould arrive at the Embryo which it nouri≈øheth; but ≈øeeing the Yelk is ≈øo far from re≈øembling the Embryo, that no Part of the Chicken is formed out of it, (for it onely ≈øerves for a gro≈ø≈øer ≈øort of nouri≈øhment for it) the like liquor in an Hen pa≈ø≈øeth onely through the outer Coat which an≈øwers to the <hi>Chorion,</hi> betwixt which and the inner it is collected for the u≈øe of the future <hi>Foetus.</hi> But if we will ≈øuppo≈øe with Doctour <hi>Harvey,</hi> that there are two Whites, the inner of a thicker con≈øi≈øtence, and the outer of a thinner, and that the≈øe are included each in a particular Membrane; then <hi>as</hi> the≈øe Membranes an≈øwer exactly to the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> ≈øo mu≈øt we ≈øuppo≈øe that the Coat that was borrowed from the Ovary, was <hi>originally</hi> double, and now onely <hi>begins to appear</hi> ≈øo. (But enough of this.) The Egg then beginning to encrea≈øe in bulk on this manner at fir≈øt in the <hi>Proce≈øs</hi> of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus,</hi> doth by degrees de≈øcend down into the <hi>

But any Country Hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife may decide this controver≈øie as well as the≈øe great Philo≈øophers, who by feeling with their Finger whether the Hen be with <hi>≈øoft</hi> or <hi>hard</hi> Egg (as they u≈øe to phra≈øe it) know whether ≈øhe will lay that day or no: for if ≈øhe do, the Egg feels, comparatively, hard, though not quite ≈øo hard as after it is lay'd.</p>

                           <note place="margin">4. How an Egg becomes fruitfull.</note> 
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If one compare an Egg lay'd by an Hen that hath never been trod by a Cock, one ≈øhall not find it differ in any one re≈øpect (≈øo far as the Eye can judge) from another that is lay'd by one that has u≈øed to be trod every day; ≈øo that it ≈øeems difficult to give a rea≈øon why the one ≈øhould be fruitfull, and the other not. I think it is peculiar to a tame Hen (of which we are ≈øpeaking) to lay as well without a Cock as with him: in whom therefore the treading is no efficient cau≈øe of the Egg, but onely of making it fruitfull.</p>
                        <p>Now it is very con≈øiderable what Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> and others have ob≈øerved, that one treading is ≈øufficient to fertilize a whole knot of Eggs, be they twenty or a greater number; which be≈øides what we ≈øhall ≈øay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, may ≈øufficiently detect the vulgar opinion of Errour, <hi>viz.</hi> that tho≈øe ≈øpecks in the Yelk which we commonly call <hi>the treddle,</hi> are the Seed of the Cock; for how can he be imagined to ≈øpend ≈øo much at one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57416:178"/>time as all the≈øe mu≈øt amount to? But to pa≈øs by that, it is certain that none of the Cock's Sperm can come to the Ovary; for if the Cock have any <hi>Penis</hi> at all (which Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> denies) yet it is ≈øo ≈øhort that it cannot reach one quarter of the way between the outer Orifice and the Ovary: yea that part that is between the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> and outward Orifice, which an≈øwers to the <hi>Vagina</hi> in Viviparous Animals, is ≈øo full of folds and wrinkles that one cannot pa≈øs any thing from without inwards, not ≈øo much as a Bri≈øtle; ≈øo that it is not ea≈øy to conceive how the Cock's <hi>Penis</hi> (if he have any) ≈øhould penetrate even ≈øo far as the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus,</hi> which yet is two or three inches di≈øtant from the Ovary. But notwith≈øtanding the <hi>impo≈ø≈øibility</hi> of the Sperm's reaching the Ovary, and the <hi>improbability</hi> that it is injected ≈øo far as into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus;</hi> yet it is without all que≈øtion that the fruitfulne≈øs of the Eggs is wholly owing to ≈øome virtue derived from the Seed. Not that any of its gro≈ø≈øer ≈øub≈øtance doth con≈øtitute any part of the Egg; but ≈øome ≈øubtil <hi>effluvia</hi> or ≈øpirituous ≈øteams exhale from it into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus,</hi> which a≈øcend from thence by the Proce≈øs and Tunnel to the Ovary, fecundating the ≈øame. I ≈øay the rudiments of the Eggs are fertilized in the Ovary; for it is not probable that the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> onely ≈øhould be impregnated thereby with a fecundating virtue or power, which it imparts to the Egg after its de≈øcent from the Ovary into it. For though in a tame Hen the Yelks ≈øeparate and fall off from the Ovary of their own accord, whether ≈øhe be trod or no: yet in other Fowls it is not ≈øo, in whom, naturally, the Hen lays no Eggs if ≈øhe be withheld from the Cock: and it is not to be imagined but that the Eggs of both are made fruitfull in the ≈øame place. Seeing then it is owing to the geniture of the Cock not onely that the Eggs of wild Fowl become fruitfull, but that they lay any at all; (and therefore the prolifick virtue of the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mu≈øt be exerted upon the Ovary from whence the Eggs i≈ø≈øue:) we may from hence conclude, that though a tame Hen (by a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty) do lay without treading; yet as the≈øe Eggs are all of them addle, ≈øo tho≈øe that are hatchable into Chickens were fecundated before they were parted from the Ovary; for it would be ab≈øurd and unrea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øo great a difference in the impregnating the Eggs of the ≈øame Species of Animals, as the contrary opinion intimates, <hi>viz.</hi> that one ≈øhould be made fruitfull in the Ovary, and the other in the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But thus much may ≈øuffice to have ≈øpoken of the origine, encrea≈øe and fruitfulne≈øs of an Egg; it remains to examine by what means and degrees a Chicken is formed out of it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">An Egg what.</note> 
                           <hi>ARi≈øtotle</hi> in his Fir≈øt Book <hi>of the hi≈øtory of Animals,</hi> ≈øays, an <hi>Egg</hi> is that <hi>ex cujus parte fit principio Animal, quod generatur: ex altera alimentum ip≈øi generato, i. e.</hi> of one part whereof the Animal is generated, and of another, nouri≈øhed. It is both the ≈øeed and principle of the Young, and al≈øo the Womb wherein it is formed, fo≈øtered and nouri≈øhed. Out of one Egg is but one Chicken generated: for if at any time there be two, then are there really two Eggs included in one Shell, as we many times ≈øee two Kernels in one Nut-≈øhell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Its Parts.</note> Now that we may the better know out of what part of the Egg the Chicken is formed, and by which part nouri≈øhed, we are to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> of an Egg.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt and outmo≈øt is the <hi>Shell,</hi> which is as the <hi>Womb</hi> wherein the Chicken is hatched. The next is the <hi>White</hi> (or as Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> will have it, two Whites, the outer being thinner, and the inner thicker) which an≈øwers to the nutritious Juice or Chyle in the Womb of Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals, and from which the Chicken by its umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its fir≈øt nouri≈øhment. And indeed it might as properly be called Chyle, as the Chyle whereby the <hi>Foetus</hi> in Viviparous Animals is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed, is called <hi>Albumen</hi> or an <hi>albugineous</hi> Liquor, deriving that name from the White of an Egg, which is ≈øo called in Latin: for their names may well be confounded, ≈øeeing they are not onely of the ≈øame u≈øe, but of the ≈øame nature al≈øo both as to colour and ta≈øte, and agree particularly in this, that both of them by the warmth of the Fire will congeal into a gelly.</p>
                        <p>The next part is the <hi>Yelk,</hi> in Latin called <hi>Vitellum,</hi> from <hi>vita,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Chicken <hi>lives</hi> by it. It is otherwi≈øe named <hi>Luteum</hi> (the <hi>Yelk</hi> or <hi>Yellow</hi>) from its <hi>colour.</hi> This part al≈øo ≈øerves for the nutrition of the Chicken, but is of a more terrene and gro≈øs nature than the White, and therefore comes to nouri≈øh it onely in the ≈øecond place, when the White is ≈øpent, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed farther by and by. Both the Yelk and the White are each inve≈øted with a Membrane; yea if there be two Whites, as Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> affirms, then is the inner and thicker White divided by a proper Membrane from the outer and thinner. Which two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the White an≈øwer exactly to the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios</hi> in Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals, which contain the chylous or albugineous Liquor for the nouri≈øhment of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as was hinted in the foregoing Chapter. In the Membrane that cloaths the Yelk, towards each end of the Egg is placed a ≈øpeck or little tran≈øparent knot, which are commonly called the <hi>Treddles,</hi> from an opinion that they are the Sperm of the Cock, and that the Chicken is formed out of them. But ≈øeeing there are two in each Egg (one towards each end) if the≈øe were the Seed or fir≈øt vegetative princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Chicken, then ≈øhould there be two formed out of every Egg. But Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> does mo≈øt ingeniou≈øly call them the <hi>Poles</hi> of this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57416:179"/>
                           <hi>Microco≈øm,</hi> ≈øerving for no other purpo≈øe, than for the uniting of the Yelk to the White; for though they adhere to the Membrane that inve≈øts the Yelk, yet does the larger diameter or half of them jet out into the White. They are called in Latin <hi>Grandines,</hi> Hail-≈øtones, from their colour, as being of a more white and lucid ≈øub≈øtance than the White, and re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling much both in ≈øhape and colour the ≈ømaller Hail-≈øtones when they have been a little wet.</p>
                        <p>Having enumerated all the≈øe parts of an Egg, and not ≈øuppo≈øing any of them to be that which is the fir≈øt principle of the Chicken, it may be wondred by ≈øome, what part is left to which we can a≈ø≈øign that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The opinion of the often before-cited Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> is clear and convincing as to this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is neither of the Knots before-mentioned, but another white, round and ≈ømooth Speck (about as big as a Lentil) that likewi≈øe adheres to the Coat of the Yelk, about the middle ≈øpace betwixt the Treddles. And though it is very little, yet that can be no prejudice to the opinion, with him that con≈øiders, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions (or <hi>Ova</hi>) of Viviparous Animals, even of the mo≈øt bulky, are no bigger than a Mu≈øquet-bullet, when they are ≈øeparated from the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Ovary, which ≈øtate this white Circle or ≈øpeck is now conceived to be in, and of which I ≈øhall ≈øay no more, le≈øt I ≈øeem to impo≈øe upon the learned and ingenious Reader, whom I would rather advi≈øe to peru≈øe Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> him≈øelf as to this opinion, than ≈øatisfy his curio≈øity with this ≈øhort Ab≈øtract of it. But partly for the ≈øake of tho≈øe that want Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi>'s Book <hi>De generat. Animal.</hi> and partly that what follows may be the better under≈øtood, I thought it convenient to give a touch of it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">5. By what means and degrees a Chicken is formed out of it.</note> Having then concluded upon the fir≈øt <hi>Seed</hi> or principle out of which the Chicken is formed, let us next con≈øider by what <hi>means</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> it <hi>vegetates,</hi> and has an Animal generated out of it. We have ≈øhewn in the foregoing Chapter, that as to the examination by the Eye, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a fruitfull Egg which is not in an addle one; yea even this white Circle or Speck la≈øt mentioned is equally found in both: and the rea≈øon why it is barren in one and fruitfull in another is its <hi>being</hi> or <hi>not</hi> being impregnated by the Cock's Sperm; ≈øuch Hens as are not trod laying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways addle Eggs, but ≈øuch as are, for the mo≈øt part prolifick. (But of this enough before.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The means is Incubation.</note> Now the <hi>means</hi> of putting this generative (or more properly, I think, <hi>vegetative</hi>) principle into act, is the <hi>incubation</hi> or brooding of the Hen, which influences this <hi>Seed</hi> (or Egg within an Egg) out of which the Chicken is formed, even as the cheri≈øhing and benign beams of the Sun fo≈øter the Seeds that are committed into the Bo≈øom or Womb of their kind Mother the Earth. Onely here is the difference, that the Seed or Egg of a Plant contains nothing but the vegetative principle, in which as ≈øoon as the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick power is excited, it attracts nouri≈øhment from <hi>without</hi> it ≈øelf, from the Capillary Veins or <hi>meatus</hi> of the Earth, as was ≈øhewed at large in the fir≈øt Chapter; whereas the Egg is both Seed and Womb, containing all <hi>within</hi> it ≈øelf, nece≈ø≈øary both for the formation and nutrition of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> The rea≈øon of which is apparent, namely, that a Plant (be it an Oak of two or three hundred years old) is ≈øtill but an Infant in regard of its nutrition, by its Roots as by ≈øo many Mouths ≈øucking the turgid Brea≈øts of its teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mother: whereas a Chick (like all other Animals) as ≈øoon as its Parts are once formed and animated, is pre≈øently emancipated, as it were, from the Womb of its Mother, neither receiving nor needing any further

Now though the ≈øitting of the Hen excite the pla≈øtick power in the afore≈øaid white Circle, yet is there no vertue derived to it from the Hen her ≈øelf, ≈øeeing an elementary heat which is as gentle, equal and con≈øtant as that of the Hen, will have the ≈øame influence upon it. Thus as Hi≈øtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans relate, the Egyptians u≈øed to hatch their Eggs by the warmth of a Stove; and thus the E≈øtriches Eggs being covered with Sand are hatched by the warmth of the Sun, (which in <hi>Africk</hi> where the≈øe Fowls are bred, is much more inten≈øe than in the≈øe <hi>European</hi> Countreys) the Hen her ≈øelf neglecting that office, if the opinion of divers Commentators upon the Book of <hi>Job</hi> may be relied upon, where chap. 39. ver≈ø. 14, 15, 16. it is ≈øaid, that <hi>≈øhe leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warmeth them in the du≈øt, and forgetteth that the foot may cru≈øh them, or that the wild Bea≈øt may break them. She is hardned again≈øt her Young ones as though they were not hers,</hi> &amp;c.

This Speck was al≈øo a little bigger, but without any other ≈øen≈øible alteration. At the blunt end of the Egg the hollowne≈øs, which is natural to all Eggs, was ≈øomewhat enlarged, and the Yelk was ri≈øen ≈øo near it, that it might be ≈øeen through the White, or rather through the Membrane of the White, the White it ≈øelf being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt wholly retired to the ≈øharp end.

                           <note place="margin">3 Third day.</note> At the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> day, I took a third Egg, and breaking it at the narrow end, I found a great alteration in it from the ≈øtate it was in the day foregoing. For in the centre of the afore≈øaid Speck I ob≈øerved a little red Body of the colour of bloud, ≈øometime plain to be ≈øeen, and anon di≈øappearing (by turns.) In the circumference of the Speck a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty di≈øtance from the centre there was a reddi≈øh Circle, betwixt which and the red Body in the centre there run very many ≈ølender red ≈øtreaks. The red Body ob≈øerved a con≈øtant turn of dilating and contracting it ≈øelf (like to the pul≈øation of the Heart, which Part it afterward proved) for almo≈øt a quarter of an hour, in which time the Egg being grown cold, its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then cea≈øed. By this motion it appears there is now a progre≈øs made from vegetation to ≈øome degree of Animality. The ≈ølender red ≈øtreaks that run from the centre to the circumference, ≈øeemed all to ari≈øe from one Trunk, and afterwards proved the Navel-ve≈ø≈øels, which branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out both into the White and Yelk convey nouri≈øhment from thence to the Chicken.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">4 Fourth day.</note> At the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>fourth</hi> day all the≈øe Parts before-mentioned appeared more plain. The little red Body in the centre now ≈øeemed to con≈øi≈øt of two parts, whereof whil≈øt the one contracted it ≈øelf, the other was dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and on the contrary; which gave me a ≈øu≈øpicion, that one of them was the Heart, and the other the Earlets, who≈øe contractions and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations (or ≈øy≈øtole's and dia≈øtole's) in perfect Animals ob≈øerve that tenour; and ≈øo I perceived they afterwards proved. The bloudy ≈øtreaks were now extended further than the reddi≈øh circle, both towards the White and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Yelk: and the Trunk from whence they ≈øprang, looked not now ≈øo fair red as it did before, but ≈øomewhat more dusky, as if ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an a≈øhy or dull white colour adhered to its out≈øide, being as it were of a woolly ≈øub≈øtance, and ≈øticking upon the Trunk of the Vein like mo≈øs upon the bough of a Tree. The cavity at the blunt end of the Egg was grown a pretty deal larger than before. The two little red Bodies continued their beating longer than the one had done the day before; and as ≈øoon as they cea≈øed I took them out, and al≈øo the A≈øh-coloured part of the Trunk of the Vein, and put them in fair-water; wherein as the fir≈øt pre≈øently lo≈øt their colour, ≈øo the latter lo≈øt its ≈øhape and a≈øpect it had within the Egg; for I had fancied it to appear like the fir≈øt rudiment (or <hi>≈øtamen</hi>) of the Body of the Chicken; but the woolly ≈øub≈øtance was not of con≈øi≈øtence firm enough to retain its former figure in the water: however I perceived as well by the experiment of the next days Egg, as al≈øo by another Egg that I ≈øince broke on the fourth day, that I had fancied right. The form it was in, when taken out of the Shell on this fourth day, you have delineated in the <hi>fir≈øt Figure</hi> of the following Table,

                           <note place="margin">5 Fifth day.</note> At the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>fifth</hi> day the two little red beating Bodies were grown of a fainter colour, for by this time the Parenchyma of the Heart was begun to gather about them. A little di≈øtance from the≈øe there appeared the fir≈øt rudiments of the Head, con≈øi≈øting of four bubbles, two of which were clear and tran≈øparent, but the other two of different colours. The two clear ones were the Brain and Cerebel, and tho≈øe of different colours were the Eyes: The≈øe two la≈øt appeared much bigger than either of the other. One might al≈øo di≈øcern the Bill which looked white. In the ≈øame Egg I ob≈øerved likewi≈øe the rudiments of the Lungs and Liver, which la≈øt gathered upon or grew out of the Umbilical Vein. The woolly ≈øub≈øtance before-≈øpoken of, that gathered about the Trunk of the Vein, was now of a more ≈øolid and clo≈øe contexture, and did plainly appear to be the fir≈øt rudiment of the Carka≈øe of the Chicken, out of which both Wings and Legs were begun to bud and to be very di≈øcernable. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, though all its Parts were imperfect, did yet appear to have life in it, for I could ob≈øerve it to bow it ≈øelf to and again. Of what form it appeared when it was taken out of the Liquor wherein it ≈øwam, you have delineated in the <hi>≈øecond Figure</hi> of the following Table, being drawn by one that was taken out of an Egg that the Hen had ≈øat upon five days compleat; which Embryo as al≈øo all the re≈øt that we ≈øhall hereafter in the following di≈øcour≈øe ≈øpeak of, I did pre≈øerve by a Liquor prepared for that purpo≈øe, and have them all hanging up again≈øt a Board in the ≈øame po≈øture as they are repre≈øented in the ≈øaid following Table.</p>

The Heart had acquired its proper ≈øhape, but looked white, as did al≈øo the Lungs and Liver; the Eyes ≈øtood gogling out of the Head, and each of them was as much bigger than the Brain, as the Head (taking in all its Parts) was bigger than all the re≈øt of the Body. The Brain and Cerebel were as yet onely of a watery ≈øub≈øtance, of which the latter ≈øtood jetting out above the former. One might make ≈øome faint di≈øcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Spine or Back-bone, looking whiter than the re≈øt of the Parts about it, as al≈øo of the Ribs that were extended forward from it like the fine≈øt and white≈øt threads of Lawn. There were al≈øo the Lineaments of the Inte≈øtins, which, as al≈øo the Heart, Liver and Lungs, may be ≈øeen without di≈ø≈øection; for as yet and for ≈øome days after, all the trunk of the Body lieth open before, ≈øo that the Entrails lie bare, the fir≈øt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body beginning backwards and reaching forwards by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; even as Ship-carpenters begin with the Back or Keel of the Ship fir≈øt, and rai≈øe up her Sides from thence. The Legs were not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent at this time, but the Feet were al≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed into Claws, both which it could move.

(Though in another Egg broken at the ≈øame time, which another Hen had ≈øat on, I could ≈øee the Heart move without di≈ø≈øection.) I perceived the Chicken to move its Legs, Wings and Head, and indeed all its Parts: Its Head was almo≈øt as big as all its Body be≈øides; but e≈øpecially its Eyes continued of a prodigious bigne≈øs, ≈øtaring out of its Head: They were at lea≈øt as big as ≈ømall Pi≈øtol-bullets. The White of the Egg was a great part of it con≈øumed already on the nouri≈øhment of the Chicken; and I could plainly ≈øee its umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels now reach to the Yelk, which ≈øeemed as yet to have no part of it ≈øpent; its Parts were of different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence, ≈øome thinner and ≈øome thicker; that was thinner wherein I could perceive the capillary Threads of the Navel-ve≈ø≈øels to be di≈øper≈øed. Both the Heart, Liver and Lungs were ≈øtill of a whiti≈øh colour, and their Parenchyma had acquired no firmne≈øs of ≈øub≈øtance, though they had attained very near to their proper ≈øhape.

On its Back I di≈øcerned a great many blacki≈øh ≈øpecks, which were the rudiments of the Feathers breaking out. The Eyes continued much in the ≈øame po≈øture as on the day before, being as yet but very little drawn within their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Neither were the Brain and Cerebel as yet perfectly withdrawn to within the Skull. The White of the Egg was ≈øtill more decrea≈øed, but the Yelk little or nothing dimini≈øhed. Concerning which there is this one thing very remarkable; That though addle Eggs begin to ≈øtink and grow rotten by the warmth of the Hen, within four daies time from her fir≈øt ≈øitting on them, and every day encrea≈øe in their putrefaction the longer they are ≈øat on: yet till this time the White that remains and al≈øo the Yelk in fruitfull Eggs, retain their proper ≈ømell and ≈øavour; yea the Yelk, that is not all of it con≈øumed when the Chicken is hatched, (but is part of it received to within its Belly) I ≈øay what remains of it till then, ta≈øtes as ≈øweet as the Yelk of a new-laid Egg.

Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> ≈øays its umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels are five, three Veins and two Arteries. One of the Veins ari≈øes from the <hi>Cava</hi> above the Liver: this is the large≈øt, and ≈øends forth its branches into the White, which being now in a manner ≈øpent, the branches of the Vein begin to wither, and by degrees are obliterated: But the other two Veins which ≈øpring from the <hi>vena Portae</hi> continue longer, having their branches di≈øtributed into the Yelk, which as yet is but a very little of it con≈øumed. The≈øe are accompanied by two Arteries that ≈øpring from the <hi>Lumbares</hi> or Loin-arteries. As the White is ≈øpent, the Membranes that contain'd it, begin to ≈øhrivel up and contract them≈øelves, and to cleave one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the <hi>Chorion</hi> cleaves to the <hi>Allantoides</hi> in Viviparous Animals. The Chicken now having no Liquor to ≈øwim in (as it did whil≈øt the White remained) re≈øts its Belly upon the Yelk (which is drawn clo≈øer towards its <hi>Abdomen</hi> by the Membranes, ≈øtill more and more contracting them≈øelves) with its Head commonly under the right Wing. If one di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øect its Brea≈øt, one ≈øhall find its Heart and Lungs to have obtained almo≈øt their natural redne≈øs; but the Liver looks of ≈øomewhat a yellowi≈øh white. If one open the Head, the Brain hath acquired a pretty ≈øolid ≈øub≈øtance, whereas till of late both the Brain and Cerebel ≈øeemed to con≈øi≈øt of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water.

And this was a nece≈ø≈øary provi≈øion of Nature, that ≈øeeing the Hen affords it no nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as Viviparous Creatures do to <hi>their</hi> Young ones) but it mu≈øt be its own Carver and feed it ≈øelf after the ≈øame manner as its Mother does; I ≈øay, Nature for this rea≈øon hath prudently provided, that it ≈øhould ≈øtill be nouri≈øhed by its umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels, till its Bill have acquired ≈øome ≈øtrength, and it have learned to pick for it ≈øelf.

At the one and twentieth day therefore, or at the longe≈øt on the two and twentieth the Chicken having ≈øpent all the provi≈øion Nature had provided for it in its little man≈øion; but more e≈øpecially wanting a freer Air to breath in, it begins to be unea≈øie, and to meditate and endeavour an exit. It is to be noted that naturally there is in every Egg a little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in its broader end, which is filled (as I may ≈øay) with congenit Air: As the cavity encrea≈øes, this Air mu≈øt needs be rarefied ≈øo as to fill up the empty ≈øpace; for the Shell ≈øeems of ≈øo den≈øe and compact a ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance as to admit none of the external Air into it: or if we do ≈øuppo≈øe it to be ≈øo porous as that the outward Air can in≈øinuate it ≈øelf into it, yet will it not be ≈øufficient for ≈øo free a breathing as is nece≈ø≈øary for our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and full grown Animal; much le≈øs would that congenit Air, before-mentioned, (≈øo much rarefied as it mu≈øt be) ≈øuffice for it. The Chicken hath however ≈øome ≈øort of re≈øpiration, or el≈øe it could not peep; for that voice mu≈øt be formed by the Air in expiration. But I ≈øay it requires a freer breathing than this comes to; and therefore by ≈øcratching and pecking again≈øt the Shell, it ≈øtrives to break pri≈øon. In doing which it hath no help from the Hen, (what≈øoever ≈øome may affirm of her breaking the Shell for it) as Viviparous Animals afford to their Young, who≈øe Wombs that contain the <hi>Foetus,</hi> being mole≈øted by its tumbling, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to endeavour an expul≈øion; whence the birth is almo≈øt wholly owing to the Dam, that by her throes excludes her <hi>Foetus,</hi> and to the <hi>Foetus</hi> no otherwi≈øe than as by its motion it cau≈øes an unea≈øine≈øs to the Dam. The Shell notwith≈øtanding (that is like an external Womb) is partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ea≈øier exit of the Chicken; for by its having been kept warm ≈øo long by the Hen's brooding upon it, and by the White's being con≈øumed within it, it is now become dry and brittle, and readily admits of the impre≈ø≈øions of the Chickens Bill pecking again≈øt it; and much more ea≈øily will the Membranes wherein it is inve≈øted (which may be called its Secundines) be penetrated and broken through by ≈øuch means. The Chicken then is wholly owing to its own pains for its exclu≈øion out of the Egg; for by its Bill (as with a battering Ram) it demoli≈øhes and di≈ømantles the walls of its Pri≈øon, and pa≈ø≈øing out through the breach ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its freedom.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto it may ≈øuffice to have pro≈øecuted this in≈øtance of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an <hi>Oviparous</hi> Creature; it remains that in the next place we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to promi≈øe, to give another in≈øtance of that of a <hi>Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Animal; having done which we ≈øhall make a ≈øhort compari≈øon of the one with the other, and of both with the vegetation of the <hi>Seed</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Generation of Viviparous Creatures.</head>
                        <p>HAving fini≈øhed the hi≈øtory of the generation of <hi>Oviparous</hi> Animals, we come in the next place to that of <hi>Viviparous,</hi> wherein we ≈øhall be the ≈øhorter, by rea≈øon there is that analogy betwixt them, that to be too particular would be tedious, ≈øeeing it were but to repeat the ≈øame things over again. For an <hi>Egg</hi> is as it were a <hi>Conception without</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and a <hi>Conception</hi> may properly enough be called an <hi>Egg within</hi> the Body. I have not had my ≈øelf opportunity to examine each days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the generation of this ≈øort of Animal (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Viviparous</hi>) but have ≈øuch ob≈øervations made to my hand by the curious <hi>De Graef,</hi> who≈øe In≈øtance is in Rabbets. His ob≈øervations I ≈øhall make u≈øe of ≈øo far as they are for my purpo≈øe, omitting what is otherwi≈øe. But before I proceed to them, a few things are to be premi≈øed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Tho≈øe parts which we commonly call the <hi>Te≈øticles</hi> in Females are truly Ovaries, from whence the Eggs (one or more at a time) as they are impregnated with the Geniture of the Male, ≈øeparate, and being conducted into the Womb or its Horns, by the Trumpets, become there what we call a <hi>Conception.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Animal who≈øe generation we in≈øtance in, forms its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions not in the <hi>bottom</hi> of the Womb as a Mare and ≈øome other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do, but in its Horns, into which it is pre≈øently divided from the <hi>Vagina</hi> it ≈øelf, without any <hi>fundus</hi> or bottom at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Rabbet going with young but ≈øo ≈øhort a while, it is to be ≈øuppo≈øed that all things even from the very fir≈øt, proceed with ≈øo much greater ha≈øte, as their ge≈øtation is ≈øhorter than that of other Animals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectively.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Rabbet is one of the <hi>placentiferous</hi> Animals, each <hi>Foetus</hi> having its proper <hi>Placenta;</hi> whereas Mares and very many other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have no <hi>Placenta,</hi> but in≈øtead thereof <hi>Cotyledons,</hi> as was noted in the Fir≈øt Book, Chap. 28.</p>
                        <p>Having premi≈øed the≈øe things I now proceed to the ob≈øervations.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>We made the fir≈øt tryal (≈øays the above-named Authour) on a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Rabbet that had not yet accompanied with the Male, in whom the Te≈øticles were ≈ømall, but contained very many limpid Eggs, which being cut open there i≈ø≈øued out a clammy liquor like the White of an Egg.</p>
                           <p>We opened another (≈øays he) <hi>half an hour</hi> after ≈øhe had taken buck, the <hi>Cornua</hi> of who≈øe Womb lookt a little redder, but the <hi>Ova</hi> in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticles were not yet changed, unle≈øs they had remitted a little of their clearne≈øs: but neither in the <hi>Vagina</hi> nor in the <hi>Cornua</hi> could we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Seed or any thing like it.</p>
                           <p>About <hi>≈øix hours</hi> after the coupling we di≈ø≈øected another, in who≈øe Te≈øticles the Ca≈øes of the <hi>Ova</hi> inclined to redne≈øs, out of which being prickt with a Needle a clammy and clear Liquor i≈ø≈øued fir≈øt, but Bloud followed, flowing out of the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels di≈øper≈øed through the Ca≈øes. There was no Seed to be ≈øeen in this neither.</p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57416:184"/>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Four and twenty hours</hi> after the coupling we opened another, in one of who≈øe Te≈øticles we found three, and in the other five Ca≈øes of the <hi>Ova</hi> very much changed; for being before the <hi>Coitus</hi> limpid and colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, they were now turned duski≈øh and of a faint red, in the middle of who≈øe Superficies a little <hi>Papilla</hi> (or Teat) as it were, di≈øcovered it ≈øelf. When the Ca≈øes were cut open, there appeared a little limpid Liquor in their middle, and in their circumference a certain thicker and reddi≈øh Matter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Twenty ≈øeven hours</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we in≈øpected another, the <hi>Cornua</hi> of who≈øe Womb with the Oviducts or Trumpets looked more bloudy, al≈øo the extremity of the Oviduct did on every ≈øide embrace the <hi>Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> like a Tunnel. We found no Eggs in the <hi>Cornua,</hi> nor were their Ca≈øes in the Te≈øticles much altered from what they were three hours before.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eight and forty hours</hi> after the coupling we examined another, in one of who≈øe Te≈øticles we found ≈øeven, in the other three Ca≈øes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in who≈øe middle the Teats were ≈øomething more eminent, through which, by pre≈ø≈øing the ≈øub≈øtance of the Te≈øticles, there i≈ø≈øued a little liquor like the White of an Egg; but the remaining reddi≈øh ≈øub≈øtance of the Eggs being now become ≈øomething thicker, was not ≈øo ea≈øily pre≈ø≈øed out as before.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventy two hours</hi> (or <hi>three days</hi> and nights) after the <hi>coitus</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpected another, in which was great alteration; for the end of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundibulum</hi> or Oviduct did embrace the Te≈øticles mo≈øt clo≈øely, which being pull'd off we found in the Te≈øticle of the right ≈øide three Ca≈øes a little greater and harder, in the middle of who≈øe ≈øurface we ≈øaw a little knot with a ≈ømall hole in it like a Nipple; but di≈ø≈øecting the≈øe Ca≈øes through the middle, their Cavity was quite empty; wherefore we ≈øearched the ways through which the Eggs mu≈øt pa≈øs, again and again, and found in the middle of the right Oviduct one, and in the outer end of the <hi>Cornu</hi> of the ≈øame ≈øide two very ≈ømall Eggs little big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than ≈ømall Pins heads, which notwith≈øtanding their ≈ømallne≈øs are cloathed with a double coat; out of the≈øe Eggs being pricked there i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued a mo≈øt clear Liquor. In the beginning of the left Horn we found onely one Egg.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>fourth day</hi> from the coupling we opened another, in one of who≈øe Te≈øticles we found four, in the other three Ca≈øes emptied, and in the Horns of the re≈øpective ≈øides, we found as many Eggs, greater than the former, which did not ≈øtick in the Oviducts or beginnings of the <hi>Cornua,</hi> but were now rolled on towards their middle; in their Cavity we beheld as it were another Egg ≈øwimming, far clearer than in the other before.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>fifth day</hi> from the coupling we di≈ø≈øected another, in who≈øe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticles we told ≈øix emptied Ca≈øes, that had each a notable Nipple, through who≈øe hole we ea≈øily put an ordinary Bri≈øtle into their Cavity. We found al≈øo the ≈øame number of Eggs, bigger than tho≈øe on the day before, in divers parts of the <hi>Cornua,</hi> in which they lay ≈øo loo≈øely, that by blowing onely, one might drive them this way or that way. The inner Tunicle of the≈øe, (or the Egg within an Egg as it were) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yet more con≈øpicuous.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>≈øixth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we examined another, in one of who≈øe Te≈øticles we ob≈øerved ≈øix Ca≈øes emptied, and in the <hi>Cornu</hi> of the ≈øame
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57416:184"/>≈øide we could light of but onely five Eggs near the <hi>Vagina</hi> brought as it were upon an heap; but in the Te≈øticle of the other ≈øide we found four Ca≈øes emptied, and in the Horn of that ≈øide onely one Egg. The cau≈øe of which difference we ≈øuppo≈øe to be, either becau≈øe ≈øome Eggs by the Wave-like motion of the <hi>Cornua,</hi> (not unlike the peri≈øtaltick motion of the Guts) being carried downwards towards the <hi>Vagina</hi> were driven forth; or becau≈øe being con≈øumed in the Ca≈øes they came not to the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus;</hi> or light on ≈øome other mi≈øchance. The≈øe Eggs were as big as ≈ømall Pea≈øe.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>≈øeventh day</hi> from the <hi>coitus</hi> we examin'd another, in who≈øe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticles we found ≈øome Ca≈øes emptied that were greater, redder and harder than the foregoing, and ≈øaw as many tran≈øparent tumours or cells in divers parts of the <hi>Cornua;</hi> out of which being opened we turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eggs as big as Pocket-pi≈øtol Bullets, in which we could di≈øcern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the inner Tunicle very plain and a mo≈øt clear humour. It is wonderfull that in ≈øo ≈øhort a ≈øpace of time the Eggs ≈øhould imbibe ≈øo great plenty of liquor, that whereas before they might ea≈øily be taken out of the Womb, now they could very difficultly.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>eighth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we opened another, in the right Horn of who≈øe <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> we ≈øaw one, in the left two cells; one of the≈øe was almo≈øt twice as big as the other: for Nature doth ≈øometimes ≈øo vary, that there are Eggs of divers bigne≈øs found not onely in divers Animals of the ≈øame ≈øpecies di≈ø≈øected at the ≈øame di≈øtance from the <hi>coitus,</hi> but al≈øo in one and the ≈øame Individual. In the Horns of the Womb being opened we ≈øaw the Eggs a little bigger than the day before; but all of them, their Tunicles breaking, poured out their clear liquor before we could take them quite out: for which rea≈øon we tried another di≈ø≈øected likewi≈øe the eighth day after the <hi>coitus,</hi> to take out who≈øe <hi>Ova</hi> we u≈øed the greate≈øt circum≈øpection; but their Tunicles were ≈øo very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they bur≈øt as the former: which when we ≈øaw, the Eggs that remained we boiled with the Womb, whereby the liquor that was in them harden'd like the Whites of Hens Eggs.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>ninth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we di≈ø≈øected another that was old; The Te≈øticles of this were almo≈øt as big again as tho≈øe of younger: In the right we ≈øaw two, in the left five Ca≈øes lately emptied; and be≈øides the≈øe, others that lookt very pale, which we judged to be tho≈øe that had been emptied the <hi>coitus</hi> before this, although for the mo≈øt part they leave onely ≈øome pali≈øh points or ≈øpecks, to which the increa≈øe of the Te≈øticles is owing. The Ca≈øes of the la≈øt <hi>coitus</hi> had each a Teat upon them, but the others were ≈ømooth. In the right Horn there were two, and in the left five Cells, who≈øe ≈øub≈øtance being more rare and clear than the other parts of the Womb, was interwoven with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny twigs of Veins and Arteries. Opening ≈øome of the≈øe Cells, we could ≈øee the Eggs, but could not take them out whole; wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelled to examine the content of the Eggs in the very hollow of the Cells, we found it clear like Cry≈øtal; in the mid≈øt whereof a certain rare and thin cloud was ≈øeen to ≈øwim, which in other Coneys di≈ø≈øected likewi≈øe on the ninth day after the coupling, for its exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finene≈øs e≈øcaped our ≈øight. The inner ≈øub≈øtance of the Cells, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which receives the hypoga≈øtrick Ve≈ø≈øels, being more tumid than the re≈øt, exhibited the rudiments of the <hi>Placenta.</hi>

                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57416:185"/>
                           <p>The <hi>tenth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we in≈øpected another, in who≈øe right Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticle we found one Ca≈øe alone emptied, which by rea≈øon of the Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈ø≈øels di≈øper≈øed plentifully through it was redder and had a le≈øs Teat; in the middle of it there appeared as yet a very ≈ømall Cavity: but in the left Te≈øticle we found ≈øix ≈øuch Ca≈øes. In the Horns of the Womb we found al≈øo ≈øo many Cells, namely one in the right and ≈øix in the left, di≈øtant a finger's breadth one from another; in the mid≈øt of which Cells lay a rude mucilaginous draught of the Embryo like a little Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; one might al≈øo plainly di≈øcern the <hi>Placenta,</hi> to which the Egg by means of its <hi>Chorion</hi> was annexed. The liquor of the Eggs being boiled with the Womb hardned like the White of an Egg, and ta≈øted like the boiled congealed ≈øub≈øtance of the Eggs in the Te≈øticles.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>twelfth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we opened another, in one of who≈øe Te≈øticles we found ≈øeven, in the other five Ca≈øes emptied, and as many Cells in the Horns much bigger and rounder than the foregoing, in the middle of which the Embryo was ≈øo con≈øpicuous, that one might in a ≈øort di≈øcern its Limbs, having two bloudy ≈øpecks and as many white ones in its Brea≈øt: In the Paunch there grew a certain mucilaginous ≈øub≈øtance inclining here and there to red. We could not di≈øcern more in this ≈øhapele≈øs little Animal becau≈øe of its tenderne≈øs.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>fourteenth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we di≈ø≈øected another, which had the Cells in the <hi>Cornua</hi> yet larger than the foregoing, and the Bloud-ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels more, and more turgid. We al≈øo noted that the Cells the larger they grew, came al≈øo nearer to one another, the ≈øpaces between them being ≈øhortned. The Membranes <hi>Amnios</hi> and <hi>Chorion</hi> were knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tearing which we ≈øaw an Embryo (≈øuch as the eleventh Figure of the following Table repre≈øents) with a clear and pellucid head, with the Cerebel copped: its goggle Eyes, gaping mouth, and in ≈øome ≈øort its little Ears might be di≈øcerned al≈øo. There was a draught of its Back-bone, of a white colour, which bending in about the <hi>Sternum,</hi> re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Keel of a Ship: By its ≈øides there run very ≈ølender Ve≈ø≈øels, who≈øe Branches were extended to the Back and to the Feet. The two bloudy ≈øpecks in the Brea≈øt, being greater than the foregoing were the rudiments of the Ventricles of the Heart; at the ≈øides whereof were ≈øeen two whiti≈øh ≈øpecks for Lungs. In the Paunch being opened there fir≈øt ≈øhewed it ≈øelf a reddi≈øh Liver, then a white body, to which was knit a mucilaginous matter like a writhen thread, being the rudiments of the Stomach and Guts: All which in tho≈øe that we di≈ø≈øected after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, had acquired onely a greater bulk and perfection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent tediou≈øne≈øs by repeating the ≈øame things, we will on purpo≈øe pa≈øs by all the other Di≈ø≈øections we made in this kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture excepting onely one which we made the day before the kindling, that tho≈øe things that in the former were onely confu≈øedly di≈øcerned, may appear plain in this.</p>
                           <p>At length on the <hi>twenty ninth day</hi> after the <hi>coitus</hi> we in≈øpected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had kindled ≈øix weeks before, and in the <hi>coitus</hi> by which ≈øhe was impregnated had voided all the thicker part of the geniture of the Male, which in ≈øome mea≈øure did re≈øemble the con≈øi≈øtence of a mo≈øt limpid gelly. In her Te≈øticles we found eleven little whiti≈øh Ca≈øes; and be≈øides the≈øe, others far le≈øs, little or nothing differing from the ≈øub≈øtance of the <hi>Te≈øtes.</hi> The≈øe Ca≈øes of the Eggs in the Te≈øticles ≈øeem not to vani≈øh wholly, but to leave a certain ≈øpeck in them; whence it</p>

                           <p>certainly comes to pa≈øs, that Conies the oftener or the more young ones they bring forth, have the greater and whiter Te≈øticles; ≈øo that one may gue≈øs by onely viewing the <hi>Te≈øtes,</hi> whether they have had many young ones or often. Having viewed the Te≈øticles we pa≈øt to the Horns of the Womb, which we found no longer di≈øtingui≈øhed into Cells, but all along di≈øtended like a Pudding: which was ≈øo agitated with a Wave-like motion, like the peri≈øtaltick of the Guts, that the young ones neare≈øt the <hi>Vagina</hi> as yet included in their Membranes, were excluded, and that ≈øo ha≈øtily, that if we had not cut out the whole <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>terus</hi> they had all certainly gone the ≈øame way. The Womb was no thicker than when they are not with young, (otherwi≈øe than it is in Women.) In its Cavity we ≈øaw eleven <hi>Foetus</hi> ≈øprawling, which were all ≈øo clo≈øely coupled together by the Membrane <hi>Chorion</hi> (wherein all are ≈øeverally involved) as if they had all been included in one and the ≈øame <hi>Chorion.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Analogy, or likene≈øs, between the generation of Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous and Viviparous Animals; and how far the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of both agrees with the vegetation of Plants.</head>
                        <p>SUppo≈øing, what has been demon≈øtrated by the foregoing di≈øcour≈øe, that the fir≈øt principle of the <hi>Foetus</hi> both of <hi>Oviparous</hi> and <hi>Viviparous</hi> Animals, is an <hi>Egg,</hi> and that the <hi>Seeds</hi> of Plants have analogy thereto, and may properly enough be comprehended under the ≈øame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we ≈øhall as briefly as may be, con≈øider the corre≈øpondence that one of the≈øe has to another in their procedure towards the production of a perfect Animal or Plant of their re≈øpective kinds.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Vegetables,</hi> the Sun is the common <hi>father</hi> of their whole <hi>genus</hi> or ≈øtock, for by his irradiation alone it is that any of their Seeds (or Eggs) are matured and become fruitfull: not but that the <hi>Mother</hi>-plant her ≈øelf produces the whole ≈øub≈øtance of the Seed; but its becoming fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferous or vegetative, is owing wholly to the ethereal and mo≈øt pure and ≈øubtil influence of the Sun. In like manner the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Eggs in <hi>Oviparous</hi> Animals, or of a Conception in <hi>Viviparous</hi> is derived onely from the Female, who≈øe Egg or Conception it is; but the vegetative or pla≈øtick power re≈øiding therein is derived from the impregnation (or if you will, <hi>irradiation</hi>) of the ≈øpirituous geniture of the <hi>Male,</hi> by who≈øe influence alone they are rendred capable of producing a <hi>Foetus</hi> of their proper ≈øpecies.</p>
                        <p>The Seed, Egg or Conception then being indowed with a vegetative virtue by the≈øe means, have need of ≈øuitable nouri≈øhment for the encrea≈øe of the fir≈øt lineaments and rudiments of that which is produced out of them. <hi>Seeds</hi> are emancipated from the Womb of their <hi>natural</hi> Mother the Plant, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Pod or Shell) and committed to that of their <hi>Fo≈øter</hi>-mother, the Earth. Into which they are no ≈øooner received, but they begin to imbibe the nitrous and bal≈øamick juices wherewith ≈øhe abounds, through their hulls or husks, by which they are made to ≈øwell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe in bulk. And even ju≈øt thus in <hi>Viviparous</hi> Animals, as ≈øoon as an <hi>Ovum</hi> is ≈øeparated from the Te≈øticle and arrives at the Womb, being cloathed with two Membranes (that an≈øwer to the husks of the Seed) it pre≈øently begins to imbibe ≈øome of the albugineous liquor that plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bedews the ≈øides of the Womb at the time when a Conception is made: this liquor I ≈øay is imbibed through the Membranes, for as yet there is no Ve≈ø≈øel formed to convey it, nor does the Conception ≈øtick to any part. And thus al≈øo the little white ≈øpeck in an Hen's Egg, as ≈øoon as the vegetative virtue thereof is excited by the gentle warmth of the Hen brooding upon it, attracts unto it ≈øome of the thinne≈øt and pure≈øt of the White, whereby it is enlarged in its dimen≈øion. And this encrea≈øe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to all three, before there are any the lea≈øt lineaments of that which afterwards is produced from them.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57416:188"/>
                        <p>In the next place the Seed begins to put forth a gemm or ≈øprout, which is as the fir≈øt <hi>Embryo</hi> of the Plant; and at the ≈øame time the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf (which ≈øerves for the <hi>Placenta</hi>) and Navel-knot are ≈øhaped. By the Navel-knot, which knits the Seed-leaf and trunk of the Plant toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is nouri≈øhment conveyed from <hi>that</hi> to <hi>this</hi> for its further growth. In like manner the fir≈øt thing that appears tending towards a <hi>Foetus</hi> in an Egg or a Conception, is the red beating ≈øpeck and ≈ømall reddi≈øh ≈øtreaks proceeding from it, that prove the Navel-ve≈ø≈øels, which in Viviparous Animals that are placentiferous, are implanted into the <hi>Placenta</hi> or Womb-cake, from whence they derive nouri≈øhment to the Embryo. In Oviparous, that have no <hi>Placenta,</hi> they are in≈øerted into the Membranes that contain the White and Yelk, which Membranes 'tis probable may have ≈øome Glands adhering to them, through which the ≈øaid liquors are tran≈øcolated into the Navel-ve≈ø≈øels, and therefore may an≈øwer to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyledons in ≈øuch Brutes as are not placentiferous. At the ≈øame time or pre≈øently after appear ≈øome lineaments of the Spine, or trunk of the Body, an≈øwering to the trunk of the Plant.</p>
                        <p>The next progre≈øs of the vegetation of a Seed towards a Plant is the putting forth of Roots, which are as the Head and Mouth of the Plant, by which it ≈øucks nouri≈øhment all its life-long from its Nur≈øe-mother the Earth. In corre≈øpondence whereto the fir≈øt part (next to the before-mentioned) that attains to any con≈øiderable bulk or perfection of ≈øhape in the <hi>Foetus</hi> of Animals, is the Head, which by the two la≈øt before-going Figures you may perceive both in Chickens and Rabbets to be at fir≈øt well nigh as big as all the Body be≈øides. The rea≈øon of which <hi>ha≈øty</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure in the formation of this part ≈øeems to be for two rea≈øons: <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> that the Brain whic his the ≈øpring of the Animal function, might arrive at a capacity of elaborating and tran≈ømitting the Animal Spirits, by the Nerves, to all the parts of the little Animal, for the performing of ≈øuch weak and imperfect motions as are nece≈ø≈øary for it in that ≈øtate. And <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that its Mouth might be in a forwardne≈øs towards ≈øo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as is nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øipping or ≈øucking and ≈øwallowing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bugineous nutritious juice wherein it fluctuates, and which its parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now grown more bulky and firm begin to ≈øtand in need of for their further nouri≈øhment and encrea≈øe.</p>
                        <p>But now our <hi>Foetus</hi> (whether the off-≈øpring of a Viviparous or Ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Creature) being advanced beyond the ≈øtate and rank of Vegetables into that of Animals, we cannot deduce the parallel any further with that propriety and accuracy as hitherto: though it might ≈øtill be further pro≈øecuted according to the mo≈øt ingenious ob≈øervations of Doctour <hi>Grew</hi> in his Anatomy of Trunks, who hath di≈øcovered in them not onely ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sap-ve≈ø≈øels an≈øwering to the Veins and Arteries (yea to the Milky-ve≈ø≈øels and Lympheducts) but Air-ve≈ø≈øels likewi≈øe, as if Plants were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Re≈øpiration al≈øo, and con≈øequently of ≈øome degree of Animality, wanting onely local motion and (perhaps) ≈øen≈øe to difference them from true Animals. But to doe this would carry me beyond my purpo≈øe, which was to compare the <hi>generation</hi> (or rather fir≈øt <hi>vegetation</hi>) of the one to the other, and not their after-<hi>nouri≈øhment</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> I ≈øhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here break off the parallel or analogy of Vegetables with <hi>Animals;</hi> but ≈øhall continue a little further that of <hi>Oviparous</hi> and <hi>Viviparous</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals one with another.</p>

                        <p>By that time the purer part of the White of an Egg is the greate≈øt part of it exhau≈øted by the umbilical Veins, and ≈øpent in the encrea≈øe of the parts of the Chicken; its Bill, Mouth, Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have attained to that perfection as that they can perform their office of ≈øipping and ≈øwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby the remainder of the White, that is more thick and earthy, comes to be con≈øumed al≈øo. For that the Chicken ≈øwallows ≈øome of it, is plain, ≈øeeing if one open the Crop of one newly hatched, there is a clear liquor in it of the ≈øame con≈øi≈øtence, colour and ta≈øte with the White, which can be conveyed thither no other way but by ≈øwallowing. In like manner the <hi>Foetus</hi> of <hi>Viviparous</hi> Animals having arrived at ≈øuch maturity as to have their Mouths, Stomachs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perfected, though they continue ≈øtill to receive part of their nouri≈øhment by the umbilical Vein, (even as a Chicken after it hath con≈øumed all the White, yet ≈øtill derives nouri≈øhment from the Yelk by other branches of the ≈øame Ve≈ø≈øel) yet partly that the Stomach may be initiated into that office it is to perform after the birth (<hi>viz.</hi> concoction,) and partly that the <hi>Foetus</hi> may be trained up and accu≈øtomed to that way of feeding whereby they are to be ≈øu≈øtained after their expul≈øion from the Womb, they ≈øuck in at their Mouth a gro≈ø≈øer ≈øort of nutritious juice, (an≈øwering to the thicker White in an Egg) wherein they ≈øwim in the <hi>Amnios:</hi> which liquor is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither by the umbilical Arteries of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in this manner. The umbilical Vein being implanted into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> or Cotyledons of the Womb, does imbibe therefrom that nutritious juice that is conveyed thither by the hypoga≈øtrick and ≈øpermatick Arteries of the Dam: which juice con≈øi≈øting of various particles is conducted to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> with who≈øe Bloud it mixes, and its purer particles are a≈ø≈øimilated to it; but the gro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer and more earthy pa≈øs from the <hi>Foetus</hi> by its umbilical Arteries <hi>towards</hi> the <hi>Placenta</hi> or Cotyledons again; but in their way thither-ward they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into tho≈øe branches of the≈øe Arteries that are di≈øper≈øed through the <hi>Amnios,</hi> and are ≈øpued out of their extremities into its cavity, where this liquor is collected in great quantity for the u≈øe afore≈øaid.</p>
                        <p>La≈øtly, when the Chicken hath ≈øpent all its provi≈øion, and is grown ≈øo big that it becomes unea≈øie in its narrow Cloi≈øter, and likewi≈øe wants a freer air to breathe in, the Shell which is the Mother's (exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) Womb, begins to be brittle and apt to chap, ≈øo that upon the Chickens bu≈øtling about and pecking again≈øt it, it cracks and gives way to its Exit. Thus when the <hi>Foetus</hi> (in <hi>Viviparous</hi> Creatures) is full grown, and the ≈øides of the <hi>pelvis</hi> permit not any further exten≈øion of the Womb, the <hi>Foetus</hi> wanting Elbow-room as we ≈øay, tumbles about and creates an unea≈øine≈øs to the Dam, and the Womb it ≈øelf is provoked to an endeavour to exclude its burthen which is now become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome: whence partly from the endeavours of the Young to free it ≈øelf of its confinement, and partly by the ≈øtraining of the Dam (Nature having prepared the pa≈ø≈øage) the birth ≈øucceeds.</p>

                        <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the Motion of the Chyle, and Circulation of the Bloud.</head>
                     <p>I Am now entring upon ≈øo trite a Subject, and which has exerci≈øed the Pens of ≈øo many learned Anatomi≈øts, that I cannot invite the learned Reader to the peru≈øal of this Di≈øcour≈øe with the promi≈øe of outdoing tho≈øe worthy Per≈øons that have gone before me: but the main inducement of the annexing this to the before-going Treati≈øe, was from a pro≈øpect that this Book will probably fall into the hands of ≈øuch as never read the before-mentioned Authours, ≈øo that this Doctrine will be as new to <hi>them</hi> as if never any thing had been writ before on the ≈øame Subject. But yet I would not ≈øo prejudice even the learned (Anatomical) Reader again≈øt it, as that he ≈øhould expect nothing but <hi>Crambe recocta,</hi> and ≈øo nau≈øeate and reject it: for be≈øide that the manner and method of the di≈øcour≈øe is (I think) new, he will find ≈øomething of Experiment, which (for any thing that I know) hath not been made by any other. However in the whole I ≈øhall be very conci≈øe, as having ≈øaid ≈øomething to the ≈øame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe in the Fir≈øt and Second Books, in the Chapters of the Stomach, Guts, and Me≈øentery, and of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">I. ¬ß. Of the motion of the Chyle.</note> In the fir≈øt place we ≈øhall begin with the motion of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Chyle</hi> is that out of which <hi>Bloud</hi> is made. <hi>Chyle</hi> is defined to be a <hi>milky juice, like Barley-cream, prepared and concocted in the Stomach from the Food that is taken.</hi> For when the Animal has chew'd his Meat ≈øufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby minced and prepared it, (in which action the <hi>Saliva</hi> or Slaver mixes with it) he ≈øwallows it down into his Stomach, which ≈øo contracts it ≈øelf, that be the Meat little or much, it embraces it clo≈øely, and keeps both its Orifices ≈øhut. The Meat being thus ≈øtew'd as it were by the mild heat of the Stomach, enters upon a fermentation, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the acidity of the <hi>Saliva</hi> and the acid or acrimonious ≈øerment of the Stomach working upon the <hi>≈øalt</hi> particles of the Food and di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or precipitating the ≈øame, (and together with them the <hi>≈øulphureous</hi>) which being ≈øo di≈ø≈øolved are diluted and turned into a fluid ≈øub≈øtance by the water or other liquor that the Animal drinks, and this is that we call <hi>Chyle.</hi> As for the other particles of the Food which are not thus di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and made fluid, as being of a more gro≈øs and earthy ≈øub≈øtance, they become like the Chymi≈øt's <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> and make that we call the <hi>fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> or Dung, which having once mentioned, my de≈øign will not give me occa≈øion to take much further notice of.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57416:190"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Chyle</hi> then being thus prepared in the Stomach pa≈ø≈øes by degrees out at its lower Orifice into the Guts, along which it is gently conducted (together with the <hi>faeces</hi>) by their peri≈øtaltick or Worm-like motion. Now into every one of the Guts are in≈øerted more or fewer of tho≈øe <hi>Veins</hi> which are called <hi>milky,</hi> from the whiti≈øh chylous liquor that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in them, and to di≈øtingui≈øh them from the Bloud-ve≈ø≈øels that look of a blui≈øh or dusky red. The≈øe milky Veins being laid (as I may ≈øay) into the Guts like ≈øo many ≈ømaller (leaden) Pipes into a large Trunk, do every one of them imbibe or drink in part of the Chyle, and convey it whither and in what manner we ≈øhall ≈øhew pre≈øently. The part that ≈øu≈øtains the≈øe Veins is the Me≈øentery, in who≈øe folds the greate≈øt part of the Guts are gathered (all but the beginning of the fir≈øt <hi>(≈ømall)</hi> Gut, and la≈øt <hi>(≈øtreight)</hi> Gut.) But as for the fabrick of the≈øe parts I would rather de≈øire the Reader to con≈øult the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth Chapters of the Fir≈øt Book, than be tedious with repetition. I ≈øay then the≈øe Veins being laid into the Guts, receive into their mouths the afore≈øaid liquor through the ≈øpongie ≈ølime that bedaubs the in≈øide of the Guts, which ≈øerves as a ≈øtrainer for the confu≈øed ma≈øs of the Chyle. But for the more ea≈øie ≈øeparation of its purer parts from the impure and fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, there happens in the Guts them≈øelves a new kind of fermentation in the Chyle by the commixture of the bile and pancreatick juice with it, as was ≈øhewed in the afore≈øaid Chapters and the thirteenth of the ≈øame Book. Now the rea≈øon why the Chyle ≈øhould rather divert into the≈øe ≈ølender Ve≈ø≈øels than continue its cour≈øe down the wide Guts, is not from any magnetick or electrick attractive faculty in the Ve≈ø≈øels them≈øelves, but from the continual agitation and ≈øqueezing of the Guts partly by their own peri≈øtaltick motion, and partly by their being heaved up and down by the continual motion of the Mu≈øcles of the Paunch, and of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff in Re≈øpiration. The≈øe motions indeed ha≈øten al≈øo the de≈øcent of the chylous ma≈øs down the Guts them≈øelves; but he that con≈øiders the various windings of the Guts, and ob≈øerves that the ≈ømall ones lie the greate≈øt part of them in the lower and fore-part of the Belly (into which mo≈øt of the milky Ve≈ø≈øels are in≈øerted) whil≈øt the <hi>Colon</hi> (that lies more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) a≈øcends up again as high as the bottom of the Stomach, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is pretty full ≈øtuft with dige≈øted excrement of a pretty firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence, mu≈øt needs conceive it to be a very natural motion for the Chyle to regurgitate as it were, or ≈ølide into the milky Veins while the Inte≈øtins are thus compre≈ø≈øed. And if this may be allowed for a ≈øufficient mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical rea≈øon of its fir≈øt entrance into them, we ≈øhall not need to be much thoughtfull for another, why it ≈øhould a≈øcend by <hi>them</hi> and the thoracick Duct to the Heart; ≈øeeing that which comes behind mu≈øt needs drive on that which went before ≈øo far as there is pa≈ø≈øage for it, at lea≈øt ≈øo high as the place from which their de≈øcent was. For every body knows that any Aqueduct will convey the water as high as the Fountain or Well-≈øpring where it receiv'd it, though in its pa≈ø≈øage from the Spring-head to the place where it is di≈øcharged, it de≈øcends through a valley that is (≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe) an hundred paces perpendicular lower than either. All Meat and Drink then being received in at the Mouth, it is no wonder that the Chyle that is made of it ≈øhould a≈øcend up as high as the Heart, though it fir≈øt de≈øcend to the lowe≈øt parts of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ≈øeeing the Heart comes ≈øo much ≈øhort of the height of the Mouth. But this motion of the Chyle that we are ≈øpeaking of, has a notable advantage above that of water
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57416:191"/>in a Tree or Pipe; ≈øeeing water de≈øcends, and con≈øequently a≈øcends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in onely by its own <hi>gravity,</hi> and is a≈ø≈øi≈øted in neither by the Ve≈ø≈øels that contain it: whereas the Meat and Drink are not onely <hi>driven</hi> down into the Stomach by the motion of the Throat and Gullet; but the upper mouth of the Stomach pre≈øently clo≈øing upon them, hinders their a≈øcent back again, and the afore≈øaid peri≈øtaltick motion of the Guts, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal dilatation and contraction of the Belly (as well as Brea≈øt) in re≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, force the Chyle along the pipes it pa≈ø≈øes through, as well as it ≈øelf makes its way by its own weight. The milky Veins have al≈øo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage above an Aqueduct, in that they have Valves that hinder the relap≈øe or retreat of the liquor contained in them; ≈øo that upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever agitation or compre≈ø≈øion of the Ve≈ø≈øels there is a way open for it forwards, but it cannot return back again.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chyle</hi> then being received into the Lacteals as afore≈øaid, holds on its cour≈øe in them through the Me≈øentery to the <hi>common Receptacle</hi> at the Loins. In this pa≈ø≈øage the <hi>venae Lacteae</hi> enter ≈øeveral glands of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery, out of which other branches ari≈øe again, and the≈øe al≈øo are in≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into other glands, and other branches ≈øpring from them again, the branches them≈øelves likewi≈øe ino≈øculating one with another; but they all hold on forwards towards the great gland at the centre or root of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery where it adheres to the Loins, into which ≈øome enter and ≈øome march over it: But tho≈øe that enter it, ari≈øe again out of it, and joining with the others that ran over it, di≈øcharge them≈øelves all together into the <hi>common Receptacle</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This Receptacle is called <hi>common,</hi> becau≈øe it is common both to the Chyle and <hi>Lympha</hi> (which latter humour what it is, you may ≈øee in the above-cited twelfth Chapter.) It is ≈øeated behind and a little above the great gland at the centre of the Me≈øentery, rather towards the left ≈øide, by the ≈øide of the <hi>Cava</hi> de≈øcending, and near the left Kidney. It is like a little bag or bladder, and is nothing el≈øe but the wider part or root of the <hi>thoracick Duct,</hi> which is continued from it. All the Chyle being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into this Receptacle, and al≈øo the <hi>Lympha</hi> returning from all the Bowels of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the inferiour parts, mixing with and dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, a≈øcend up the Loins and Back by the ≈øaid <hi>thoracick Duct,</hi> which is a long Pipe (very thin and almo≈øt tran≈øparent) running up the whole length of the <hi>Thorax</hi> under or behind the <hi>Aorta</hi> (on the in≈øide of the Spine) but rather inclining towards its left ≈øide; and at la≈øt pa≈ø≈øing under the <hi>Thymus</hi> it opens into the lower ≈øide of the left ≈øubclavian Vein, over again≈øt that place where the left jugular Vein opens into it on the upper ≈øide. Though the Duct u≈øually be but one, yet it opens with five or ≈øix mouths into the ≈øaid Vein, all which on the in≈øide the Vein are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one broad valve, which permits the Chyle and <hi>Lympha</hi> to enter into the Vein, but hinders either them or Bloud to ≈ølide out of the Vein into the Duct. This Duct has ≈øeveral Valves in it as well as the Lacteals of the Me≈øentery that hinder the retreat of the humours contained in it. You have this Duct with the Receptacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expre≈øt in the next Table but one, <hi>viz.</hi> the forty ninth and la≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Chyle being di≈øcharged into the Subclavian Vein is therein mixed with the Venal bloud, and pa≈ø≈øes along with it to the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, where it begins to be alter'd into Bloud. We cannot therefore pur≈øue its motion any further under its own name: for though it be not perfectly turned into Bloud, it may be, in ≈øeveral times pa≈ø≈øing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57416:191"/>through the Heart in its circulation with the Bloud; yet it is ≈øo jumbled and mixt with the Bloud, that it is e≈øteemed to be of the ≈øame ma≈øs with it. So that we ≈øhall leave it here, and onely adverti≈øe this further, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ≈øtricte≈øt examination and mo≈øt accurate experiments of the be≈øt Anatomi≈øts, all the Chyle pa≈ø≈øes the≈øe ways we have de≈øcribed, and no part of it is conveyed either to the Liver or Spleen, nor yet to the Womb in the time of its Ge≈øtation, or to the Udder in giving ≈øuck; I mean immediately and by proper Ve≈ø≈øels; for it does indeed pa≈øs thereto, ≈øome part of it, by the Arteries, being confounded with the Bloud, from which it is there ≈øeparated again, for the nouri≈øhment of the <hi>Foetus</hi> or Young, as was ≈øhewed at large in the twenty eighth and twenty ninth Chapters of the Fir≈øt Book.</p>

                        <note place="margin">II. ¬ß. Of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bloud.</note> That the <hi>Bloud</hi> is continually ≈øome of it i≈ø≈øuing from,and other ≈øome returning to the Heart, by a <hi>circular</hi> motion, is now an opinion ≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally entertained, that I need not take any pains to prove <hi>That</hi> it is ≈øo, but ≈øhall onely ≈øhew <hi>How</hi> and by what <hi>Ways</hi> this motion is performed.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Its pa≈ø≈øage from the right to the left Ventricle of the Heart.</note> In the foregoing Paragraph we had traced the Chyle to the <hi>right</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, into which it enters mixed with the venal Bloud in the Heart's <hi>dia≈øtole</hi> or dilatation. Herein the Chyle and Bloud are more intimately mixed one with another, and 'tis probable enter upon ≈øome degree of fermentation, but it cannot be much, con≈øidering their ≈øhort ≈øtay therein, which is but during the interval betwixt the dilatation and the contraction that next ≈øucceeds it: for by the following <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> is all that Bloud and Chyle expelled out of the Ventricle into the pulmonary Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that was imported into it from the <hi>Cava</hi> by the foregoing <hi>≈øy≈øtole.</hi> The≈øe humours then, which from henceforward we ≈øhall ≈øpeak of under the notion of <hi>Bloud onely,</hi> being entred into the <hi>pulmonary Artery,</hi> are conveyed by its two branches into both Lobes of the Lungs; the ≈ømaller twigs of which branches ino≈øculating with the like twigs of the <hi>pulmona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Vein transfu≈øe the Bloud into them, which by this latter Vein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the left Ventricle. The Bloud in its pa≈ø≈øage through the Lungs being in≈øpired or impregnated with the nitrous particles of Air received into the Lungs in In≈øpiration and there in≈øinuating them≈øelves into the Bloud, undergoes a greater fermentation in the left Ventricle than it had done before in the right, though it make no longer ≈øtay in the one than in the other.

In the next <hi>≈øy≈øtole</hi> therefore of the Heart the ≈øame Bloud is driven forth of this left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta</hi> or great Artery, which is the root of all the Arteries in the Body (except the pulmonary.) I ≈øhall not need here to de≈øcribe the Valves at the orifices of the Ventricles, which hinder the recour≈øe of the Bloud <hi>into</hi> them (≈øuch are tho≈øe of the pulmonary Artery and <hi>Aorta</hi>) nor tho≈øe that hinder the regurgitation of the Bloud <hi>out of</hi> them into the <hi>Cava</hi> and pulmonary Vein; for of the≈øe we have ≈øpoken enough in the eighth Chapter of the Second Book: but we ≈øhall proceed to trace the cour≈øe the Bloud further takes, now that we have follow'd it as far as the beginning of the <hi>Aorta.</hi>

Ju≈øt where the great a≈øcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> ≈øends forth the ≈øubclavian Arteries ≈øide-ways, it is divided into two large branches (called the carotid Arteries) that a≈øcend directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which fir≈øt ≈øending ≈øome ≈ømall ≈ølips to the Tongue, the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> &amp;c. are afterwards each ≈øubdivided into the <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Internal</hi> branches. The <hi>External</hi> are be≈øtowed on the Mu≈øcles of the Lips, Cheeks, Temples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Internal</hi> entring the Skull at the hole by which the wandring pair of Nerves (or <hi>eighth</hi> pair) come out of it, are di≈øper≈øed through the Brain, the <hi>dura</hi> and <hi>pia mater,</hi> in which they make the <hi>Rete mirabile</hi> and <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> uniting with ≈øome twigs of the cervical Arteries before-mentioned. The Bloud that flows by the≈øe Arteries to the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after it hath ≈øerved the nece≈ø≈øities thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns back again towards the Heart by the <hi>Jugular</hi> Veins, which are al≈øo <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Internal,</hi> ob≈øerving the ≈øame cour≈øe with the Arteries. The <hi>External Jugular</hi> is that which appears ≈øo fair in the Neck, which we commonly open in Hor≈øes. And here it may be convenient to inquire in what manner the Bloud pa≈ø≈øes out of the Arteries into the Veins, whether by ino≈øculating the one with the other, or by what other way. That I might ≈øatisfie my ≈øelf herein I made the following Experiment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">An Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that there are no Ana≈øtomo≈øes of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with the Veins.</note> Having bled an Hor≈øe to death, that both Veins and Arteries might be empty, with the greate≈øt di≈øpatch I could, whil≈øt the Hor≈øe was warm, I took up one of the carotid Arteries and cut an hole in it pretty near the Brea≈øt, into which hole putting a quill I blew into it as hard as I could, whereupon I perceived the branches of Arteries on both ≈øides of the Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ≈øwell, yea and al≈øo the carotid Artery on the other ≈øide of the Neck: but I no ≈øooner left off blowing, but they were immediately emptied again, the wind, 'tis likely, proceeding forward, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øide, towards the Heart. Upon which I tyed the Artery on the other ≈øide about the ≈øame place where I had made the hole on this, to ≈øtop the progre≈øs of the wind, and then blew again; upon which the Arteries on both ≈øides were very much di≈øtended: and then I ≈øpeedily made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature a little above the Orifice, whereby the Arteries and all their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57416:192"/>branches in the Neck, Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> continued di≈øtended. Which having viewed a-while, I took off both the Ligatures one after the other, and perceived the wind to retire both ways, and to leave the Arteries and all their branches empty. But all this while the jugular Veins were not ≈øwelled at all: upon which I made this conclu≈øion, That the Arteries did not ino≈øculate with the Veins at all, but onely with one another. In which opinion that I might be further confirmed, I afterwards took up the external jugular Vein on one ≈øide, making a hole in it, and tyed the ≈øame Vein on the other ≈øide; I put my quill into the orifice I had made, and blew into it as I had done into the Artery before; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the jugular Vein on the other ≈øide of the Neck ≈øwelled as well as that on this ≈øide, and both their branches about the Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As ≈øoon as they were all well filled, I made a ligature above the orifice, whereby the Air was pent in, and both Veins and their branches continued to be ≈øwell'd till I unloo≈øed the Ligatures, upon which they pre≈øently became empty. But by thus blowing into and filling the Veins, the Arteries were not at all moved, which further ≈øatisfied me, that there are no Ana≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øes between the Veins and Arteries, by which the Bloud ≈øhould pa≈øs out of the≈øe into tho≈øe or out of tho≈øe into the≈øe; but that ≈øuch are onely to be found among≈øt Ve≈ø≈øels of the ≈øame kind. I ≈øpeak as to the <hi>habit</hi> of the Body; for that there are ≈øuch in ≈øome of the Bowels, as particularly of the pulmonary Artery and Vein in the Lungs, of the ≈øplenick Artery and Vein in or near the Spleen, and of the <hi>Porta</hi> and <hi>Cava</hi> in the Liver (the fir≈øt of which from its double coat may be e≈øteemed rather an Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than a Vein) is pa≈øt di≈øpute. It may be wondred then, if indeed there be a circulation of the Bloud, how it ≈øhould pa≈øs out of the Arteries into the Veins, if there be no communication by ino≈øculation betwixt them. But we mu≈øt con≈øider that in living Bodies all the parts are much more porous and ≈øpongie than in a dead Carca≈øe; for upon the ce≈ø≈øation of the motion of the humours many of the ≈ømaller pa≈ø≈øages by which they u≈øe to be conveyed, are ≈øtopt by the coinciding of their ≈øides. So that although, according to the Experiment, there is after death no pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage even for wind out of the Arteries into the Veins, nor on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of the Veins into the Arteries; yet in living Bodies it is not, from hence, nece≈ø≈øary to deny it. For though we cannot grant any ino≈øculation of the one with the other (in the habit of the Body, as was above≈øaid;) yet there is another way whereby the humours may be transfus'd out of one into another, and that is thus: The Arterial bloud by the pul≈øation of the Heart is extrava≈øated or driven forth of the utmo≈øt ends of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the very ≈øub≈øtance of the parts; which being rare and porous permits the Bloud to flow in; but the pores being very ≈øtrait can contain but a ≈ømall quantity, and therefore ≈øeeing the influx of the Bloud is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, there mu≈øt al≈øo be a continual efflux or di≈øcharge of the ≈øame, for which office there are no other Ve≈ø≈øels adapted but the Veins, which by their extremities imbibe or ≈øuck up the Bloud being thus extrava≈øated, and convey it back into the larger branches, and the≈øe di≈øcharge it into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and that, to the Heart. Now that the Bloud is extrava≈øated out of the Arteries into the ≈øub≈øtance of the parts is very certain, ≈øeeing if it were not ≈øo, the parts could receive no nouri≈øhment from the Bloud; for while it is in the Ve≈ø≈øels, it may indeed contribute warmth to the parts through which it flows, but it cannot nouri≈øh them, ≈øeeing even the larger Ve≈ø≈øels them≈øelves are not nouri≈øhed by that ≈øtream of Bloud
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57416:193"/>that glides along their cavity, but by capillary Ve≈ø≈øels running along their coats. Again≈øt this manner of the Blouds pa≈ø≈øing out of the Arteries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veins I know nothing can be objected, unle≈øs it be the ha≈øty cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Bloud, which according to the computation of the mo≈øt accurate Anatomi≈øts is ≈øuppo≈øed to be ≈øo quick, as that the whole ma≈øs of Bloud pa≈ø≈øes ≈øeveral times through the Heart in one hours ≈øpace: from whence ≈øome think it nece≈ø≈øary to admit of <hi>Ana≈øtomo≈øes</hi> of the Arteries with the Veins all the Body over, whereby the Bloud may run in a fuller current out of one into the other, than 'tis probable it can do by way of extrava≈øation; though from the nutrition of the parts, they believe it nece≈ø≈øary to admit this latter way too. To this objection I ≈øhall onely oppo≈øe the before-going Experiment, which to me ≈øeems a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration that there are no ≈øuch <hi>Ana≈øtomo≈øes</hi> at all. Having therefore ≈øhewn all the branches of the <hi>A≈øcending</hi> Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> we ≈øhall proceed to tho≈øe of the <hi>De≈øcending.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The De≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Trunk of the Aorta.</note> The <hi>De≈øcending</hi> Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> is larger than the <hi>A≈øcending,</hi> as being to ≈øupply more parts with heat and nouri≈øhment. It de≈øcends by the Gullet towards the Midriff, at which before it arrive, it ≈øends forth the <hi>inferiour Interco≈øtal</hi> branches, and the <hi>Bronchial,</hi> which latter accompany the branches of the Wind-pipe in the Lungs. When it arrives at the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, there ≈øpring out of it, the Phrenick Arteries, which are di≈øper≈øed through the Midriff, and <hi>Media≈øtinum</hi> or Partition-membrane of the Che≈øt. Having pierced the Midriff, it de≈øcends in one Trunk as far as the la≈øt <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra</hi> of the Loins, but by the way ≈øends forth many branches: as fir≈øt the <hi>Coeliaca</hi> or <hi>Stomach</hi> Artery, which ari≈øes ≈øingle, but is divided afterward into its <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left</hi> branches. The <hi>right</hi> furni≈øheth the right ≈øide of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pylorus</hi>) the inve≈øting Membrane of the Liver, the Gall-bladder, the right ≈øide of the Caul and that part of the <hi>Colon</hi> on which it cleaveth, the beginning of the ≈ømall Guts, and the Me≈øentery: The <hi>left</hi> (called its <hi>Splenick</hi> branch) ≈øends ≈øome twigs to the middle part, left ≈øide and upper orifice of the Stomach, and to the left part of the Caul; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt part of it runs to the Spleen, into which before it enters, it ≈øometimes ≈øends forth the <hi>vas breve arterio≈øum,</hi> which goeth to the left part of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stomach: but in Hor≈øes this <hi>vas breve</hi> ≈øpringeth from it after it is entred into the Spleen, as may be ≈øeen in the ≈øeventh Table annexed to the ≈øixteenth Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book, where all the≈øe branches of the ≈øplenick Artery are delineated. The Veins that accompany this Coeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Artery are branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> and have the ≈øame names with tho≈øe of the Artery. Next to the Coeliack there ≈øprings out of the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> the <hi>upper Me≈øenterick,</hi> that is be≈øtowed upon the upper part of the Me≈øentery and the ≈ømall Guts. The next are the <hi>Emulgent</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the right and left; each of which dividing them≈øelves into two or more branches, enter into the Kidneys of their re≈øpective ≈øides, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge there the <hi>≈øerum</hi> or wheyi≈øh part of the Bloud that makes the Urine. Below the≈øe the <hi>Aorta</hi> ≈øends forth the <hi>≈øpermatick</hi> Arteries, which in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes are commonly two, and in Mares o≈øt-times more, on each ≈øide. The≈øe run to the Te≈øticles, Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the <hi>lower Me≈øenterick,</hi> that go to the lower part of the Me≈øentery and to the great Guts. By this time the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> being come to the top of <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> having thus far de≈øcended under the <hi>Cava,</hi> begins to climb upon it, and is divided into two equal branches, called the <hi>Iliack;</hi> which are pre≈øently ≈øubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>interior</hi> and <hi>exterior.</hi> From the <hi>interior</hi> ≈øpring the <hi>Mu≈øculae,</hi> or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57416:193"/>Mu≈øcle-arteries, being be≈øtowed on the <hi>P≈øoas,</hi> the Buttock-mu≈øcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> al≈øo the <hi>Hypoga≈øtrick,</hi> that run to the parts of Generation in both Male and Female, and al≈øo to the Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and la≈øtly the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>mbilical</hi> Arteries, which in the <hi>Foetus</hi> a≈øcending by the ≈øides of the Bladder, proceed to the Navel, and run to the Womb-cake or Cotyledons; of which in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighth Chapter of the Fir≈øt Book. From the <hi>exterior Iliack</hi> branches ari≈øe <hi>fir≈øt</hi> the <hi>Epiga≈øtrick</hi> Arteries, which turning upwards run on the out≈øide of the Rim of the Belly, betwixt it and the ≈øtreight Mu≈øcles, as far as the Navel, and there meet the <hi>Mammary.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Pudendae,</hi> which are ≈øpent upon the Privities of both Male and Female. Afterwards the <hi>Iliack</hi> branches de≈øcend to the Thighs, and then begin to be called <hi>Crural.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have given an hi≈øtory of all the larger branches of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> whereby the Bloud is conveyed from the Heart to all the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it would not be very material to give the like of the <hi>Veins,</hi> ≈øeeing every one of the≈øe Arteries has a Vein accompanying it, for the mo≈øt part of the ≈øame denomination; ≈øo that by knowing the Artery that comes to any part, we mu≈øt know the Vein al≈øo that returns the Bloud from it, e≈øpecially in the Limbs and outward parts. For indeed within the Body, e≈øpecially in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> there is ≈øome variation: the rather becau≈øe ≈øome of the Veins thereof ≈øpring from the <hi>Cava,</hi> and others from the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> This latter ≈øupplies the Bowels that perform the fir≈øt concoction, as the Stomach, Guts and Me≈øentery; as al≈øo the Spleen, Sweetbread, Caul, and the Liver in part. The≈øe branches of the <hi>Porta</hi> receiving into them that Bloud that is ≈øuperfluous to the nouri≈øhment of tho≈øe parts into which they are in≈øerted, unite into one Trunk in the lower or <hi>under</hi> ≈øide of the Liver; which Trunk ≈øpreading it ≈øelf into many roots through the whole ≈øub≈øtance of the Liver, does transfu≈øe its Bloud into the like roots of the <hi>Cava</hi> that ari≈øes out of the <hi>upper</hi> ≈øide. In which pa≈ø≈øage of the Bloud out of the <hi>Porta</hi> into the <hi>Cava,</hi> the Bile is ≈øeparated from it. But that Bloud which is received <hi>immediately</hi> by the branches of the <hi>Cava</hi> di≈øper≈øed to the other parts of the Lower Belly, as al≈øo by tho≈øe that run to all other parts of the Body, whether from its A≈øcending or De≈øcending Trunk, pa≈ø≈øes through no Bowel in its return towards the Heart: But being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by the capillary twigs out of the pores of the parts, is conveyed fir≈øt into the ≈ømaller branches, and from them into the larger, and la≈øtly from the≈øe into one of the great Trunks of the <hi>Cava,</hi> by which it is poured again into the right Ventricle of the Heart, there to be in≈øpirited anew and ≈øent about in a ≈øecond circulation.</p>
